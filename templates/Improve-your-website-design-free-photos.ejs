<p>We came up with a list of the top 10 totally free photo sites that you can use to improve your website design.</p>
      <h2>What we mean by free</h2>
      <p>Are you looking for free photos to use for a design and do you want to keep, yourself and your startup, out of copyright trouble? If so, you should to know this, there are the following types of free:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Creative Commons zero - </b> you can use the photos  in any way you'd like without asking permission.</li>
        <li><b>Creative Commons with attribution - </b>you can use the photo in any way you want but you need to attribute credits to the creator of the photo. Attribution is simple: when you include a photo in the web page, you need to identify the photographer ("Photo by John Doe") and include a link to the website.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>All the websites presented are free of charge and the use of their pictures is attribution free (creative commons zero).</b></p>
      <h2>Is it worth the risk?</h2>
      <p>If someone finds their content on your website, they can ask to take down your site. It works as a preventive measure to make sure you remove other people’s content for good. So if you think you can get away with using other people’s images for free, think twice. Your website can go through a DMCA takedown if you’re not careful. A DMCA takedown happens when content is removed from your website at the request of the owner of that content or its rights. DMCA is basically a copyright law. It protects those who believe their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed, due to unauthorized use of their materials on the Internet. Although the law is from USA, it can be applied anywhere in the world. Once it happens to you, you can say goodbye to all your SEO efforts. Is it really worth it for a photo?</p>
