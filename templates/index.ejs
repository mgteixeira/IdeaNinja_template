      <p>Entrepreneurs are makers.  Research, Learn, Do is the process by which we all operate. Eventually we all need a little support. And let's face it, we are all biased when it comes to our business and a second opinion is often what you need to take your company or project to the next level.</p>
      <p>At IdeaNinja, we understand that a  startup must be able to iterate. Our services are designed around that premise. We uphold a framework specifically for startups. We believe that being able to jump through a specific set of basic challenges, will go a long way making sure your startup is successful. At IdeaNinja, the price is set, duration is fixed and you know exactly what you are going to get.</p>
