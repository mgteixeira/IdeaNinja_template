      <h2>Videos: the faster alternative to books</h2>
      <p>Throughout this article, we will provide videos with summaries or talks about the books we are recommending. The idea behind it is that you get a sense of what the book is about and quickly grasp the main concepts. We do recommend you see the video and then read the book if you are interested in deepening your knowledge on the topic.</p>
      <h2>"The Lean Startup", by Eric Ries</h2>
      <p>Topic: <strong>Strategy</strong></p>
       <p>This is probably the most important book on entrepreneurship right now. Eric Ries has put together a framework that is heavily adapted by entrepreneurs all over the world and, in particular, in Silicon Valley. The crux of this book is that in case of extreme uncertainty, like the launch of a product, you often fail. And when that happens, we learn. How can we test and iterate faster, with less costs? We use two powerful concepts: developing and testing minimum viable products and pivot when needed. Take a look to Eric Ries' discuss his book.</p>

       <p>Topic: <strong>Marketing</strong></p>
       <p>In the Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell goes on to explain how ideas become widespread. There are 3 factors that can contribute to tilting the plane and get an idea to reach its tipping point and become widespread. And those are: the law of the few, the stickiness factor, and the power of context. All of these 3 aspects combined work together to offset the balance and send ideas into trends and form new habits.</p>

      <p>Topic: <strong>Marketing</strong></p>
      <p>The idea championed in this book by Chris Anderson, chief editor of Wired Magazine, is that: globalization and technological advancements has driven the cost of developing and marketing products down. And so with it, died the economy of scarcity and was born the economy of abundance. Which resulted huge increase in offer and so the customer got exactly what they wanted (several niche products) and not the middle of the road product (mass market products). You can learn all about it in this Chris Anderson talk about the long tail:</p>
