There are lots of specifics. We will explain how you should do it.</p><h2>Is writing for the web different ?</h2><p>Writing for the web is different from writing for a magazine or newspaper, even though many of the same principles apply. You want do write as simple and plain as possible so that your reader can easily understand you. Add pictures to illustrate your point. There are new subjects you should look in as well, like:</p><ul><li>SEO</li><li>scannability</li><li>directing to complementary articles</li></ul><h2>How to write simple</h2><p>Simple is a subjective term, so lets go in depth and create a structure you can work with:</p><ul><li>a Title - The title shouldn't have more than 8 words,</li><li>a Lead - The lead should be a paragraph that answers the following questions: who, what, when, where and finally the how and why.</li><li>and several paragraphs - Each paragraph should have between 3 and 5 sentences and no sentence should have more than 25 words, preferably under 20.</li></ul><img src=images/articles/Howto-write-article/papper-bin.jpg id=articleimg alt="Writing simple"><h2>Adding pictures to your article</h2><p>Pictures are worth a thousand words, so make sure to add some to illustrate your message.
