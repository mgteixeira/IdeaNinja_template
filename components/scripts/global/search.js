    "html": "\n<h2>Prepare to win</h2>\n<p>In order to increase your startup's chances for success, it helps if you understand and prepare for the challenges ahead.&nbsp;With that objective in mind, we will breakdown one of the most well known studies on startups, <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research-reports/The-20-Reasons-Startups-Fail.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"blank\">The Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail by CBinsights </a>.&nbsp;Just to be clear we are critical about how this study was conducted, but we also value the data collected.&nbsp;We will try our best to produce an insightful analysis to this study, so that we can make sense of the data collected.</p>\n<h2>Criticism about the study</h2>\n<p>The main criticism about this study is that the answer options, given by the 101 post-mortems entrepreneurs, are often filled with duplication and actually mean the same thing. Let's take for instant, \"No market Need\" and \"poor product\". A poor product is a product that the market does not need, or does not understand it.&nbsp;Another way to say the same thing is to say you had price/cost issues, which&nbsp;means that the market wasn't willing to pay as much as you needed to charge for the product.</p>\n<h2>The results:</h2>\nAfter grouping the answers by subject the results were as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>Product Market fit - 37.79%</li>\n<li>Human Resources – 24.75%</li>\n<li>Marketing – 22.41%</li>\n<li>Financing Issues – 12.37%</li>\n<li>Legal – 2.68%</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"images/articles/reasons_fail/startups_fail.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Startups fail\">\n<h2>Main Reason: Product Market Fit</h2>\n<p>When you say \"No market need\", \"Got outcompeted\", \"Pricing/cost issues\", \"Poor product\", \"Need or lack a business model\", it basically means that your market isn't willing to pay for your product.&nbsp;There is really no surprise there. Almost 40% of companies fail because of this.&nbsp;This is why the iteration/pivot approach championed by many, like Eric Ries in the Lean Startup, was written and has become the main philosophy in product development.&nbsp;The problem is clear: you need to test and keep perfecting until you have the product that the market wants.&nbsp;To assume you know what the market needs are, is frequently fatal for your startup. It is important to keep testing your assumptions and prepare your company to test frequently and fast.</p>\n<p>To do so, and deliver a product or service that the market needs, it must add value to the customer. For that reason, a business model becomes critical to highlight core aspects of the business to create value in several contexts.\n</p><h2>2nd Reason: Human Resources</h2>\n<p>This one is also not a shocker.&nbsp;Everybody has heard the story of friendships torned apart in the process of building a startup.&nbsp;Human Resources is a major challenge: from team building, to talent acquisition, capacity building, motivation, burnout, and even to dealing with investors.&nbsp;25% of all startups fail because of Human Resources.&nbsp;Many entrepreneurs fail even to recognize Human Resources as a critical factor to their success.</p>\n<h2>3rd Reason: Marketing</h2>\n<p>Oh well, the dreaded Marketing, listening to your customers, understanding your market, spreading the word, setting the price right, branding, pivoting, setting up a store in a bad location.&nbsp;So many things that can go wrong.&nbsp;Marketing is an art form and to be able to produce good marketing is crucial for any business success, specially for a startup.&nbsp;Marketing is a very close third with 22%.&nbsp;Build your team around Marketing. It is fundamental to quickly absorb marketing insights and deliver the right product to the right market when they need it.</p>\n<h2>4th Reason: Financing issues</h2>\n<p>Wow, this is a shock! I would assume this would rank much higher among the opinion of entrepreneurs, as why their startup fail.&nbsp;Only 12.37%, and yet, so much time lost preparing pitch decks, reports and meeting investors.&nbsp;It makes you wonder, if the cliche, that what is often sold is really what you should focus on.&nbsp;The truth is that most business don't need investors from the start to be successful.&nbsp;The need comes later on, when you want to scale your business. Most startups don't need huge cash injection: they need work, vision, talent and team.</p>\n<h2>5th and final reason: Legal</h2>\n<p>Only 2.68% of entrepreneurs name legal as the main reason why their startup failed. That is a very low number.&nbsp;Although it is something that you should consider, seldom is the case that legal is critical for your business. Unless your business has some specific need, it should not be your focus.</p>\n<h2>Going back to the basics</h2>\n<p>In the end, it all comes down to the ability that a startup has to deliver a great product to the market.&nbsp;How do you do that?&nbsp;With a great team with complementary skills, ready to iterate its product as fast as possible until you achieve a great product/ market fit.&nbsp;On marketing you need to understand and act in your market.&nbsp;In the end is the same old grind. Nothing new.</p>\n<h2>Many approaches</h2>\n<p>We have now identified the most common disciplines you need to be able to mitigate the most recurrent risks in entrepreneurship.&nbsp;However, these disciplines are vast.&nbsp;There are many approaches to each of them.&nbsp;So no, there is not a recipe to rule them all.&nbsp;But you can prepare you company to create a symbiotic relationship with your customers to develop and improve products. You should choose carefully whom you work with.&nbsp;And you can always improve your marketing capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<p>To produce this analysis we used the report from CBinsights, The Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail.&nbsp;Then, we proceeded to group the answers given by the 101 entrepreneurs who had their companies fail.&nbsp;We group them in the following way:</p>\n<p>Product Market Fit was composed by: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Market Need,</li>\n<li>Get outcompeted,</li>\n<li>Pricing/Cost Issues,</li>\n<li>Poor product,</li>\n<li>Need/Lack Business Model.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>Human Resources was composed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not the right team,</li>\n<li>Lose Focus,</li>\n<li>Disharmony on Team/investors,</li>\n<li>Lack of Passion,</li>\n<li>Don't use network advisers,</li>\n<li>Burn out.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>Marketing was composed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor Marketing,</li>\n<li>Ignore Customers,</li>\n<li>Product Mis-Timed,</li>\n<li>Pivot Gone Bad,</li>\n<li>Bad location,</li>\n<li>Failure to pivot.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>Financing issues was composed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ran out of cash,</li>\n<li>No financing or investing.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>And finally Legal from legal challenges.</p>\n<p>Then we proceeded to add all the elements and convert to a base 100.</p>\n<h2>Final remarks</h2>\n<p>The results shown by this analysis weren't surprising. These conclusions seem to make a lot of sense and actually look pretty obvious, which is a good thing. But that doesn't mean it is easy.&nbsp;As always, you need a lot of clairvoyance and experience to run a smooth, well machined operation that excels at these themes. And that, let me tell you, is very hard thing to do.</p>\n<p>Here at IdeaNinja, we have been contributing with several pieces on how to improve in many of these themes, with articles like: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"how_to_value_business_idea.html\" target=\"blank\">How to value a business idea</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"how_improve_facebook_post_reach.html\" target=\"blank\">How to improve facebook post reach</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"How-to-write-article-for-the-web.html\" target=\"blank\">How to write article for the web</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"basics_seo.html\" target=\"blank\">Basics of SEO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"recruiting_startup.html\" target=\"blank\">Recruiting in a Startup</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please take a look into it and thank you for your time.</p>\n"

    "html":"\n<h2>Why feedback is important</h2>\n<p>Entrepreneurs and product developers put much time and effort on getting their product ready to launch. And commonly, that is the first time they receive the first insight from customers. After months of development, their attempt to sell the product goes to failure. They realize that the customers don’t understand or need the product or its features.</p>\n<p>Lean startup methodology focuses on making the process of introducing new products into the market efficient. Thus, avoiding wasting time and resources in those features clients don’t want. This efficiency outcomes from gathering feedback from potential clients. By collecting, as much as possible, reactions and responses from targeted customers over all elements of their product or overall business. You can achieve that by prototyping, creating a minimum viable product, and product testing. For more information on prototyping you can check out our article <a href=\"http://ideaninja.io/prototyping.html\" target=\"blank\">Guide to Prototyping</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/lean-product/lean-methodology.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"lean methodology startup\">\n<h2>Failing fast and continuous learning</h2>\n<p>The Lean Startup process encourages entrepreneurs to fail, fail fast to grow faster. Don’t assume what your market wants! Start testing your products or services in early stages of development and this will allow you continuous learning throughout your product development. To do so, this methodology suggest you to start by developing an minimum viable product.</p>\n<h2>1. Develop an MVP</h2>\n<p>Don’t wait until you have the perfect product! Start by creating a minimum viable product (MVP), a version of your new product <i>“which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”</i> (as described by Eric Ries). It will have your product’s basic characteristics but in a viable way for people to use. The use of a MVP allows you to put your product in customer hands in an early stage without needing a large investment, to learn as quickly as possible. More importantly puts you in front of your customer and opens the communication channels. By doing so, you will test fundamental hypotheses on your product, that may be crucial and determinant for development of following ones. Imagine what a snowball effect would create if you get wrong the basics of your product without testing it!</p>\n<p>Building the MVP will allow you to know if your customers even use your product or services before launching it to the market. But remember, you are only going for the bare minimum! The “rule” Eric Ries suggests is to put in 20% of product’s features that 80% of customers would use. So build something cheap and fast.</p>\n<h2>1.1. Who will you ask for feedback</h2>\n<p>Give your MVP to a targeted audience and take special attention not only to their feedback but also to their behavior, their interaction with the product or service. It will probably not be as you expected! Your perception on the product is commonly different from the one from your clients, that is why their feedback is so important. But who will give you this feedback? We advise you to go for the early adopters of your product. They are the ones more predisposed to try and use new products, usually for a price, but they will give you relevant opinion. If you still don’t know who should be testing your product, it may be helpful checking out our article on <a href=\"http://ideaninja.io/influencers_word_of_mouth.html\" target=\"blank\">Influencers - The key to Word of Mouth</a>.</p>\n<h2>2. Feedback Loop</h2>\n<p>For this moment forward is all about iteration. Gather customer’s feedback and use it to tailor and improve your product, learn about what can you change to make your product better. After the adjustments, test it again in the same or new customers. Use these new inputs to adapt, once more, your product. And by doing so, you are creating a cycle, a feedback loop. Repeat it over and over again, as many iteration as it takes, until you create a really good product or service.</p>\n<h2>2.1. Metrics</h2>\n<p>It’s all about build, measure, and learn! Thus, pay special attention on how do you measure the feedback to not use the wrong metrics. The ones you want are called actionable metrics, the ones that will lead you to informed and assertive conclusions. Some example of that can be the willingness to pay or purchase frequency.</p>\n<h2>2.2. Make it cheap and fast</h2>\n<p>The faster you pass through this cycle the faster your product will succeed. Hence, focus on having short cycles with incremental improvements instead of large leaps that are based on your assumptions, since these last ones will require much more investment that can go to waste. Make sure the way you test it is the cheapest and the fastest as possible to optimize and improve your business path.</p>\n<h2>2.3. Create hypothesis</h2>\n<p>The best way to start this iteration is by creating hypothesis on what do you want to test, becoming a hypothesis-driven experimentation. You may even split your test in two different products to experiment the impact of two different version or even simple features. But remember, all your experiments should be isolated tests without contamination. Test their effectiveness in the market and learn from the experiment.</p>\n<h2>3. Pivot</h2>\n<p>Pivot differs from iteration because you are not incrementally changing your product, but doing it fundamentally. Sometimes, after going through the cycle several times you come to the conclusion that your base expectations were wrong, and so you should pivot. You do it when needing substantial changes because your initial ideas are not being effective. You will no longer do small adjustment but, instead, you will completely change your initial idea. You can either change your product, essential features, or change the audience you were trying to sell it. This pivot will be mainly a correction in your direction, to test new ultimate hypotheses of your new product or service.</p>\n<h2>3.1. Step up your competition</h2>\n<p>By correctly creating a feedback loop you will understand what is your suitable market (it may not be the one you expected in the beginning) and what it wants. And by doing so, you will be one step ahead of your competition! This because your will be receiving insights on the reactions and behavior from real users of your product, from the real world. And that is how your risk is reduced when using lean startup methodology.</p>\n<h2>Lean startup principles</h2>\n<p>Lean startup principles of failing fast and continuous learning are being successfully adopted all over the world, not only in startups but also in mature businesses. Eric Ries, the founder of this methodology, refers five key principles of the Lean Startup movement. Firstly, that <strong>entrepreneurs are everywhere</strong> and <strong>entrepreneurship is management</strong>, meaning that everyone can build a startup and if they do, it will be an institution and requires management. Then, to build a sustainable business you need <strong>validated learning</strong>, that you can achieve by experimentation of each element of your business vision. But still, to improve systematically, you need to measure, achieve milestones and prioritize work, and that entails <strong>innovation accounting</strong>. And Finally, the principle of <strong>Build-Measure-Learn</strong>, that as mentioned before is a vital activity for every startup that wants to succeed.</p>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>Although the methodology is commonly perceived as focused on product development with customer’s insights, it goes beyond that and may be used to market development and the feedback may also come from partner or other stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Lean startup methodology focuses on experimentation over planning, trying to change companies extreme focus on business plans. This methodology goes more in line with business model canvas ideals instead of business plans, leading authors to develop a lean canvas model.</p>\n<p>The use of this methodology will give your startup a better chance to succeed by reducing waste and by not develop your product around your intuition but based on what the market wants.

    "html": "\n<h2>Cost Accounting vs Financial Accounting</h2><p>Financial Accounting and Cost Accounting are two completely different realities.</p><p>While, Financial Accounting provides the relevant information for taxes and is mandatory by nature. Cost Accounting is something you because it helps you make decisions and better understand your business,due to it’s detailed information of your expenses.</p><p>An example of a cost accounting finished sheet, should be something like the following:</p><img src=\"images/articles/cost_accounting/cost_accounting.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Cost accounting analysis\"><p>As you can see, Cost Accounting provides a clean and easy reading sheet, where it becomes way clearer where you should be focusing your time and money. in the example above, you can read that although product A and C have roughly the same sales. However product A represent three times as much profit as product C.</p><h2>Why Should an Entrepreneur know Cost Accounting?</h2><p>Most business owners try to repel all the accounting work into an accountant. Truth is you should try to do some number crunching yourself. Like shown in the table above, Cost Accounting isn't as complex as financial accounting and it provides plenty of useful information. For an Entrepreneur, cost accounting has three core benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Provide Detailed Information -</strong> One of the major advantages of cost accounting, is that it empowers the entrepreneur with more information, facilitating the process of doing key decisions. If you understand your company’s numbers, then it is easier to estimate the financial impact of your decisions. Cost accounting helps you define priorities, investments and enhances the overall quality of your decisions.</li><li><strong>Monitors progress -</strong> Since Cost Accounting hands you detailed information about your operations, it becomes way easier to monitor progress and, consequently make adjustments,when necessary. It enables you to measure actual progress versus predicted progress, keeping you honest about your business numbers all the time. If you’re not hitting the targets you have set, you can identify problems and correct them.</li><li><strong>Clarifies the path to take -</strong> Another of the entrepreneur’s core objective is to make plans in a way that attracts others to work on a shared vision to change the world in some way. In the early stages of a venture, estimates can unite a team by making a blurry vision more concrete, measurable, and actionable. By analysing your expenses in detail, you can draw conclusions about: what’s the margin you get per sale, your cost structure breakdown per product, what price you need to practice to break even and plenty of other useful information.</li></ul><h2>Cost Accounting 101: Steps to do it yourself</h2><p>We already shown what Cost Accounting is and why you should do it. It’s time to pull up the sleeves and show you how to do it yourself.</p><h3>1st Step - Revenue Streams Identification</h3><p>First of all, you have to identify what your revenue streams are, in the example we handed before our revenue streams were 3 different products the company had.</p><img src=\"images/articles/cost_accounting/revenue_sources.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"revenue sources cost analysis\"><h3>2nd Step - Cost Structure Identification</h3><p>Secondly, you should identify what are the costs you support in your business. Most of the times, the following costs cover it all.</p><div><img src=\"images/articles/cost_accounting/cost_structure.jpg\" id=\"article_med_img\" alt=\"cost structure cost accounting\"></div><h3>3rd Step - Receipt Matching</h3><p>After identifying your Revenue Streams and Cost Structure you have on your business. It’s time to identify where each singular receipt goes to. This is where it starts getting tricky so buckle up. There are four basic types of costs you need to keep in mind. However, let’s define them 2 by 2 to make it simpler. Starting by the differences between fixed and variable costs.</p><ul><li><strong>Fixed costs -</strong> Fixed costs like the name specifies are costs that are fixed, no matter how much you produce or sell. A good example of this type of cost is a lease on a building. You have to pay the lease no matter how your company did in terms of sales.</li><li><strong>Variable costs -</strong> Unlike fixed costs, variable costs change with the level of production. The easiest example of this type of cost, are materials used in production because it changes according to the level of production you are doing.</li></ul><p>After defining between variable or fixed, now you have to choose between direct or indirect.</p><ul><li><strong>Direct costs -</strong>Direct costs are costs that can be directly traced to the revenue stream. Material and labor costs are good examples of this type of cost.</li><li><strong>Indirect costs -</strong>These can’t be directly traced to the product; instead, these costs are allocated, based on some level of activity. For example, if you use the same infrastructure to develop all your products you will allocate a chunk of that cost to each product being that an indirect cost of your product.</li></ul><p>Every cost can be defined with a combination of two of this four costs. For example, your electricity bill is an indirect variable cost if you use that electricity for all your different revenue streams. However, if you have a specific electricity bill per revenue stream it can be defined as a direct variable cost, because you can directly trace it to each revenue stream.</p><img src=\"images/articles/cost_accounting/cost_classification.gif\" id=\"article_med_img\" alt=\"cost analysis indirect variable\"><h3>4th Step - Indirect Cost Allocation</h3><p>Like we said before, indirect costs are costs that can’t be directly traced to a revenue stream so what you have to do is allocate those costs according to the following rules:</p><ul><li>Human Resources - Number of hours worked on that revenue stream.</li><li>Materials - Percentage of materials used on that revenue stream.</li><li>Distribution - Percentage each revenue stream represents in sales.</li><li>External Services - Percentage of usage on each revenue stream.</li><li>Infraestructures - Space occupied in factory for the production of each product.</li><li>Communication and Marketing - Percentage each revenue stream represents in sales.</li></ul><p>At the end of the allocation what you will end up getting is a Proxy Table similar to this one.</p><img src=\"images/articles/cost_accounting/cost_imputation.gif\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"KPI fixed costs analysis\"><h3>Final Step - Use the calculator</h3><p>When you get to this point, all you have to do is use your calculator. Start by multiplying your proxy table with the all the different indirect costs. Then just add them up to their respective direct costs and put them on the sheet. You will end up with a sheet similar to our initial sheet.</p><h2>Final Remarks</h2><p>Cost Accounting is one of the most underrated tools by entrepreneurs. I hope this article made you realise how useful it can be. One of the beauties of cost accounting is that even if you know nothing about accounting everyone is capable to apply this exercise on their own business providing you with critical information that otherwise you wouldn’t get.</p><p>If you found this article helpful, then you might be interested in the following ones:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/basics_of_accounting_for_entrepreneurs.html\" target=\"blank\">Basics of Accounting for Entrepreneurs</a></li><li><a href=\"/books_for_entrepreneurs_curated_list_plus_video.html\" target=\"blank\">Books For Entrepreneurs</a></li><li><a href=\"/reasons_why_startups_fail.html\" target=\"blank\">Reasons Why Startups Fail</a></li></ul>"

When it comes to advantages, Low Fidelity Prototyping has these six:</p>\n <ul>\n<li>Anyone can do it,</li>\n<li>Focused on Data and Content,</li>\n<li>Collaborative process / Social Interaction,</li>\n<li>No technical restrictions,</li>\n<li>Faster method,</li>\n<li>Low cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, like in everything, there are some disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not detailed oriented,</li>\n<li>Comprehensive paper prototypes are difficult,</li>\n<li>Collaboration implies physical proximity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>High Fidelity Prototyping - pros and cons</h2>\n<p>High fidelity prototyping are meant to test details, like design details, specific wording.

High fidelity Prototyping, has the following advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on detail,</li>\n<li>Near real experiment,</li>\n<li>They are precise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, like in everything, there are some disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It creates the expectation that the project is near finished,</li>\n<li>Requires high level of skill,</li>\n<li>Time consuming.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Prototyping tools</h2>\n<p>Prototyping tools are meant to facilitate the making of a prototype and can be very valuable in speeding up the process.There are three types of prototyping tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local,</li>\n<li>Online,</li>\n<li>Paper Resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the following paragraphs we will give examples of each kind so you can find the one that fits your purpose better.</p>\n<h2>Local tools</h2>\n<p>Here we give you some examples of Local Tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flow - Powerpoint, Keynote - High Fidelity Prototyping Tools</li>\n<li>Images - <a href=\"//www.gimp.org/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gimp</a>, Illustrator, Photoshop - Hight Fidelity Prototyping Tools</li>\n<li>Wiretypes - MS Visio, <a href=\"//www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OmniGraffle</a>- Low Fidelity Prototyping Tools</li>\n<li>Adobe Fireworks - High Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.axure.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Axure</a>- Low Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.balsamiq.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balsamiq</a>: mockups and wireframes - Low Fidelity Protoyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.justinmind.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justinmind</a> - Low Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.antetype.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Antetype</a>- High Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li>Top end &amp; comprehensive: <a href=\"//www.irise.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">iRise</a>- Low Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Online tools</h2>\n<p>There are also many online tools available for you to prototype:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"//www.moqups.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">moqups.com</a>- Hight Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.fluidui.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fluid</a>: focused on Mobiles and tablets - Low Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.hotgloo.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">HotGloo</a>: Good for responsive design, with base templates - Low Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.notism.io\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Notism</a>: Tool for collaboration - High Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.protoshare.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protoshare</a>: bootstrap built in templates - High Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.uxpin.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">UXpin</a>: Lots of collaboration and goes from mockups - High Fidelity PrototypingTool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.invisionapp.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invision</a>: Wireframe collaboration with good pricing - Low Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.proto.io\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proto.io</a>: Mobile in mind, lots of templates - High Fidelity Prototyping Tool</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paper prototype resources</h2>\n<p>Last but not least, we provide you a list with some good paper prototype resources, all of these are low fidelity prototypes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"//www.uistencils.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">UiStencils.com</a>: Ui resources</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sneakpeekit.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sneakpeakit</a>: Canvas and sheets (free)</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.sketchbook.com/mobile\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">appssketchbook.com</a>: sketchbooks</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cohdoo.com/phonedoo.php\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phonedoo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.pixeden.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pixeden</a>: Wireframe stencil with UI elements and Icons</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.webalys.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webalys</a>: Symbols in ilustrator</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.dessky.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dessky</a>: Webdesign and wireframming kit</li>\n<li><a href=\"//www.medialoot.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medialoot</a>: UI elements</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Prototyping testing</h2>\n<p>Prototyping testing accelerates the iteration process involved in fine tuning a Product or Service. Because prototyping is more agile than developing the product itself, it allows you to change quickly, test and get results and keep testing it until you have achieved a product that is valued and by your customer.</p>\n<h2>Facilitator, tester and observer</h2>\n<p>In order to do proper group testing and improve the quality of the feedback , you need three people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Facilitator - someone that sets goals for the testing sessions, explains how the process works and guides the users through the tests,</li>\n<li>The Tester - should be someone that represents your target audience and will test your product,</li>\n<li>The Observer - someone that is a part of the evaluation process and that, during the process will observe, report and take notes. He should not intervene in the test in any point in time and should remain silent and intervene as litle as possible in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may feel inclined to do 2 or 3 of the roles mentioned above. If you do so, know that you will be affecting the quality of the test.</p>\n<h2>Prototyping in services</h2>\n<p>Some say that services cannot be prototyped at all. But that is not true. Services may have several components that cannot be tested, but you can test deliverables, processes and sometimes experiences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports - From report templates, bill of services, flowcharts, excel files, every single paper or file you exchange with your customer is deemed to be prototyped, tested and tuned. </li>\n<li>Processed - From IVR, to automatic emails, to a sales process, all can be tested, prototyped and fine tuned.</li>\n<li>Experiences - One of the best way to test your service is by creating an experience as a prototype, for example, create a space where it really seems you’re having dinner at a restaurant, with waiters, background music, cosy furniture, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prototyping services can require a bit more imagination, but they are definitely testable. </p>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, prototyping is essential to save some time when it comes to create a product or service. You should never forget that there are two types of prototype: Low and High Fidelity. Each of them has its pros and cons, so you should chose the one that fits your startup’s prototyping stage better. Make sure to use some kind of ,prototyping tool. they can help you a ton. The last part, is the testing off course. And for that you need a facilitator, a tester and an observer. And if you are building a service, do not stress, you can do it.</p>\n"

    "html": "\n<h2>What’s Growth Hacking?</h2>\n<p>Growth Hacking is quite a controversial expression, being many times compared with traditional marketing, due to their similarities, but truth is they have two completely different objectives. While Marketing is mainly focused on targeting, increasing reach through paid ads or organic activities, growth hacking relies on cracking the system to become known fast and quick, looking for alternative and cheaper ways to reach growth.</p>\n<p>Growth Hacking is particularly prevalent with startups, when the goal is to create a rapid growth early on.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the main idea behind growth hacking is to find the “trigger” that creates engagement between the user base and your business. That trigger in social media is commonly known as the algorithm. Each social network platform uses an algorithm to determine which content is shown to users first and which content is put in queue. If you crack the code then you can easily “hack” your way into a larger audience. This Growth Hacking mentality has gained relevance lately due to the exponential increase of interest to advertise online rather than offline.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/growth_hacking/growth_hacking.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"growth social media hacking\">\n<h2>Growth Hacking the Social Media</h2>\n<p>When startups are still at an early stage, truth is all costs matter.</p>\n<p>Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and other social-media represent a big chunk of the timeshare of internet users. Hence social media has become one of the most powerful tools to reach your audience. Most businesses are already present in social media, using it to boost their sales or create a closer relationship with their customer. The competition for online attention is stronger than ever. <strong>How does one differentiate and succeed in growing a user base?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two main aspects you need to focus on, <strong>content</strong> and <strong>distribution</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Content in Social Media</h2>\n<p>Social Media has so much content that it has become difficult to reach your target, especially when you’re starting and you don’t have a large base of followers.</p>\n<p>Content can be simply defined as creative or informative materials. However there are a lot of questions that must be put into equation. At what frequency should I release new content? Does all my content have to be top-notch? What type of content should I aim to develop?</p>\n<p>To help you answer all those questions we created list of <strong>best practices</strong> and <strong>hacks</strong> that will most definitely grow you an engaged user base.</p>\n<h2>Best Content Practices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define your Social Media Objectives -</strong> Whether you’re present at Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn one thing that is common and crucial, in any of them is a plan of what you want to achieve. Each social media has to be seen like a living system with different necessities and interests, so make sure you know everything about the platform, which audience you can reach and what your milestones for the platform are, before you start posting.</li>\n <li><strong>Use Visuals -</strong>When communicating in any of the mass social media, one of the best practices you can have is to use visuals like videos and images, because these type of contents are highly ranked by social media, making it easier to reach more people.</li>\n<li><strong>Find your user base interests -</strong> In real life, The easiest way to make a bond with somebody, is to find something that both find interest in. In Social Media the principle is the same. For example, if your user base likes cats, but you want them to see the awesome boat you are selling, just post a cat on a boat dressed as a sailor! Be creative!</li>\n<li><strong>Be human -</strong> I can't stress enough how important this point is. When you’re writing in a social media make sure to let your audience know that you are human. When someone shows interest on any of your posts, make sure you respond and interact to them. People that feel a close relationship with you, will be more likely to interact in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Content Hacks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All your content doesn’t have to be top-notch -</strong> This topic is by far one of the biggest myths there are out there. Your content simply doesn't have to be all high quality content. If in every five posts you post one really good, then you are doing a great job. People tend to remember great posts much longer than bad ones, because if they aren’t interested in it they will just keep scrolling.</li>\n<li><strong>Post your content directly on Facebook -</strong> Facebook’s algorithm decides which content is shown the most, and one of the biggest aspects, people don’t know about, is that external links are less likely to be shown than text posts. The idea behind it is to keep people on Facebook, so what you should do to hack your way through is to directly put your content on facebook. If you want to know more about how <a href=\"https://ideaninja.io/how_improve_facebook_post_reach.html\" target=\"blank\">facebook’s algorithm works check out our article</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Share articles of influencers -</strong> Another good way to reach more people is to share content of influencers. Influencers tend to create posts that reach lots of people, so when you are sharing their content, you are driving their influence to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Best Distribution Practices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use Various Platforms -</strong> A common misconception is that, being present in only one social platform is enough. You should try to diversify, every platform is a living system and you will definitely reach different targets in each platform. Make sure you don’t release the same content on all platforms all the time, create specific content for each from time to time.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Hashtags to allow people to find you -</strong> Hashtags are one of the best resources you can use in order to make people find you, and to make your content hit your desired target.</li>\n<li><strong>Be Consistent -</strong> Once you are able to create a connection with your user base make sure you don’t stop releasing content that interests them. Don’t leave them hanging, reach and interest is something that is built over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Include Call-to-Actions -</strong> If you want your followers to do something, you need to ask them. People won’t do anything if you don’t ask them to. Asking for shares, retweets and all that, is crucial to affect as much people as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Distribution Hacks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find Influencers -</strong> When starting a new project, truth is no one cares about you. One of the biggest hacks you can get, is for someone influent to talk about you which will ultimately drive traffic onto your page. This isn't an easy job, but using ads with very specific target, you can reach your influencers. </li>\n<li><strong>Facebook Groups - </strong>Facebook is, undoubtedly, one of the most powerful social media's right now, and for a long time it has been fairly easy to drive traffic onto your Facebook page and redirect that traffic onto your webpage or blog. Truth is, that Facebook has been nerfing the potential reach of professional pages in such a big cut that the best possible policy right now, is to create and join facebook private groups and inviting relevant people onto those groups, releasing your content there, where you won’t be nerfed by facebook’s reach policy, generating buzz in a much easier fashion.</li>\n<li><strong>Make your Personal Facebook a Professional Facebook -</strong> Professional pages are undervalued and their reach is reduced on pretty much all platforms. While on a professional page you are able to reach around 10% of the people that follow you, on a personal page the reach is way higher. Share your business posts on your facebook page to increase the reach and try to develop your personal branding.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow opportunities - </strong>One of the easiest opportunities everyone has to get followers is through niche events. Every segment has at least one major event per year where people with the same interests gather. All you have to do is to go on Twitter and list the people that say they are attending to that event on that day and just follow them. One in every four will add you back, and you are not even there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>Although growing a user base is no easy task, I hope this article showed you that there are a lot of practices and hacks you can use to boost yourself up. Make sure to combine good content with good distribution and most importantly, don’t lose your focus and make sure you don’t give up at the first obstacle you find along your way. Growing a user base is a process and it takes time.</p>\n<p>If you found this article helpful, then the following articles may also interest you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how_to_manage_youtube_channel.html\" target=\"blank\">How to manage a Youtube Channel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/how_improve_facebook_post_reach.html\" target=\"blank\">How to improve your Facebook’s post reach</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/basics_seo.html\" target=\"blank\">Basics of SEO </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/How-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-SEO.html\" target=\"blank\">How to drive traffic to your website - SEO</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "html": "\n<img src=\"images/articles/influencers/word-of-mouth.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"word of mouth\">\n<h2>Who are the influencers?</h2>\n<p>Malcolm Gladwell in his book “The Tipping Point”, goes on over the three factor that make and idea reach the tipping point and engender an epidemic: the law of the few, the stickiness factor, and the power of context. He believes it all start with the power of influencers to spread messages, identifying them as people with significant power over trends. Thus, they are divided in three types that represent about 20% of the population: Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen.</p>\n<h2>1. Mavens</h2>\n<p>Mavens are usually experts, or with overpowering knowledge in a field that incite their influence by sharing their understanding and experience with others. And that is what makes them so successful in transmitting their ideas, not because they are persuasive but because they are perceived as specialists. These opinion leaders feel the need of being constantly learning, reason why they are always on top of the newest trends and technologies. That fact makes them educate their audience instead of being sellers.</p>\n<p>People look up to Mavens, and they may be your entering point into the market, into early-adopters. Frequently, these are the types of influencers more willing to help you if they do like your product. But as good as they might be for your business, they also have the power to ruin it. Some examples of these influencers are bloggers, celebrities, review sites, YouTube stars, journalists, talk show hosts, or niche media.</p>\n<h2>2. Connectors</h2>\n<p>Influencers can also be Connectors, people who have built a wide network of people, and are able to reach large groups of friends or other social connections. Connectors may even relate themselves to other Connectors making their network even wider. These people have very strong social skills, that enable them to maintain relationships with people from different backgrounds but receptive to their opinions. These rich connections turn them into trendsetters since their message is passed promptly to a broad social circle. The growth of social media platforms in people’s daily life has increased the power of these influencers and can be the perfect link between your brand or product and your targeted audience, so choose them wisely!</p>\n<h2>3. Salesmen</h2>\n<p>The final archetype Malcolm Gladwell identifies are Salesmen, and these are the most charismatic influencers of them all. They influence others by persuasion, having the power of convincing or selling their ideas to others. Their conviction and confidence on what they say make people trust them and their opinions.</p>\n<h2>What makes a influencer relevant to my brand</h2>\n<p>Influencers are important simply because customers are more receptive to their recommendations and opinions. If you make them real users of your product, you can even use them as testimonial advertising, making their opinion even more credible. However, influencers (specially Mavens) can be targeted to test your product and receive feedback. Check out how important is to receive customers’ feedback on our article on <a href=\"lean_product_testing.html\" target=\"blank\">Lean Product Testing</a>.</p>\n<h2>Different goals, different influencers</h2>\n<p>As mentioned previously, there are influencers that succeed the most on teaching, others persuading, and others communicating something to a targeted audience, so start reaching them and putting your products in their hands! If you are only trying to spread the word you might go for the Connector, if you are trying to sell your product go for the salesman, but if you want to educate your customers on your product or even sell it go for the Mavens. Ultimately you should approach all three if you want to have a strong Word of Mouth strategy and build an epidemic.</p>\n<h2>What is the right influencer</h2>\n<p>To reach the right influencer you need to make sure there is a perfect fit between your brand and the influencer, you achieve that by accomplish three main criterias:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Industry</strong>: the influencer should relate as much as possible with your industry. For example, getting your food truck reviewed by Anthony Bourdain (Maven and Connector) would boost your awareness considerably.</li>\n<li><strong>Traction</strong>: after you define your target audience, make sure the influencer can get to them. Simultaneously, your influencers should not only have a considerable number of targeted followers, but should also be able to generate interaction and engagement with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Personality and values</strong>: Make sure there is a match between your brand and the influencer personality. If the influencer will share content about your products, it should be in line with your brand image, personality, and your own content strategy. This alignment has extreme importance since it might influence your brand’s reputation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Let the influencer do their job</h2>\n<p>One important advice you should follow is: don’t try to do all the work! Influencer marketing succeed because customers trust the influencer as a credible source. If you try to decide every little thing the influencer will say or do, even if you are paying him/her for it, it may not have the impact you would want. The best way to boost the impact of your influencer campaign is by making them show your product in their own channels, with their own words. Nevertheless, it is always good to invite them to participate on yours channels and content development.</p>\n<h2>Create an excellent relationship</h2>\n<p>Influencers, as much as they can be helpful for your company, they are not part of your company. This mean that the way you interact with them is important, and it is a relationship you must work on to be meaningful and lasting. It all start with creating mutually beneficial relationship. Your brand cannot be the only one that benefits from this association, you must create value for the influencer. You can do it monetarily, with rewards, you can give them more visibility on your platforms, or any other alternative that is valued by them.</p>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>Influencer marketing opens a new form of marketing for you to get directly to your customers, it helps you strengthen and amplify your message. Thus, the right association might be vital for your success.</p>\n<p>Choose your influencers carefully, work on your relationship with them and measure the results. The best influencers will be the ones who can not only share awareness but also create action. This action can be translated in sales, number of likes on a page, or any other considered relevant to your business.</p>\n<p>Other article you may be interested in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"motivation-types.html\" target=\"blank\">Motivation Types</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"press-media-kit.html\" target=\"blank\">Media and press kit: how to for startups</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "html":"\n<img src=\"images\\articles\\life-cycle\\market-cycle.png\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"market-cycle\">\n<h2>Market Stages</h2>\n<p>As we see in the picture above, the market evolves in different stages (Introduction, Growing, Maturity and Decline. In the next few paragraphs we explain the characteristics of each of the stages and we will give examples of the best strategies to adopt in each one of them.</p>\n<h2>Introduction phrase</h2>\n<p><u>Market Conditions</u></p>\n<p>The first stage is the Introduction stage. At this time you will have undefined segments, few competitors and low sales. The consumers still have a low level of information/awareness about your company. Related to the firm itself, it has to charge a high price per customer, but will still have negative profits.</p>\n<p><u>Tactics/Decisions</u></p>\n<p>It’s important to think about some good tactics and make important decisions to improve your startups performance. Generally, in this stage, build Primary demand (innovators) and create product awareness and trial. The product should be basic with a narrow product line. You need to choose between a high price for your product if you want to recover costs (skimming) or a low price to develop demand (penetration pricing). The topic you should focus more is advertisemente and promotion and you need to invest a large amount. You need to educate your target by personal selling and demonstrations. You should also induce trial - give free samples and attempt to get PR coverage. Finally, have a selective distribution strategy.</p>\n<p><u>Creating a market</u></p>\n<p>If you entered the market at this stage, you will not have competition, the product is unique, it was you who created the market. However, the costs are very high (due to low production volumes and high Marketing costs) and there is almost certain that you will loose money in the initial years.</p>\n<h2>Growth stage</h2>\n<p><u>Market Conditions</u></p>\n<p>At this stage, the competition has already increased, the segments emerged and the sales are increasing. The consumers begin to be more informed. The company already has distribution channels and production process sharpen (efficient), the cost per customer is decreasing and the profits are increasing.</p>\n<p><u>Tactics/Decisions</u></p>\n<p>Generally, in this stage, you need to build secondary demand (market share), compete on features and watch out for “me‐too” products. The product has been innovated based on customer feedback, and already has extensions, warranties and services. As a result of the competition increasing, the price needs to be lower to penetrate the market and compete. Broaden your distribution: add more channels to meet demand. And don’t forget advertisement and promotion. Continue building brand awareness by, for example, advertising.</p>\n<p><u>Entering the market</u></p>\n<p>This stage is an excellent growth opportunity for the business, but the market is aggressive, there’s a lot of competition.</p>\n<h2>Maturity stage</h2>\n<p><u>Market Conditions</u></p>\n<p>This is the stage when the market has achieved it's full size potential. It has a very distinct segments, a high competition and peak sales. The consumers already expect something from you and demand quality and performance. Inside the firm you are looking for cost reductions in order to milk higher profits.</p>\n<p><u>Tactics/Decisions</u></p>\n<p>Generally, in this stage, you need to defend brand share, and you grow by stealing clients from competition. It is time for “freshening” brand with new claims. The product has already diversified brands and models. Its price drops to maintain share, if competition is heavy. A more intensive distribution should be built. Even though you already have a spot in the market, you have to continue promoting your product. At this point, stressing brand differences and benefits and handing coupons would be the best way to go.</p>\n<p><u>Entering the market</u></p>\n<p>This is a stage from which you can benefit if you can produce the same product at more affordable costs. There will be pressure to drop prices.</p>\n<h2>Decline stage</h2>\n<p><u>Market Conditions</u></p>\n<p>This is the last stage the market will face. You will go through a decline in sales and the segments will shrink or disappear. The preference of your customers will change and as a result, lower costs per customer. The profits will decline.</p>\n<p><u>Tactics/Decisions</u></p>\n<p>Above all, in this stage you will cut costs, reduce expenditures and milk the brand. You will be phasing out weak items and seek ways to make your product “new” again. One of the biggest concerns will be the cut in prices, so that you can sell of inventory. The place to be is more selective and you will be phasing out unprofitable channels. Advertisement and promotions need to be reduced to the level needed to retain hard-core loyals and to emphasize service.</p>\n<p><u>Exiting the market</u></p>\n<p>This is a stage where the market conditions are adverse and not suitable for you to enter the market with your product.If you are alrady in the markemt you should consider exiting the market and keep a close eye on profitability.</p>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>As you have read, following this article, the market has four stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction stage,</li>\n<li>Growing stage,</li>\n<li>Maturity stage,</li>\n<li>Decline stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these stages has its specific features and techniques that can help you improve the performance of your business. You can enter the market in any of the stages, however the most recommended are the growing or the maturity stage. Entering in the introduction stage you make yu loose money in the initial years. In the declining stage, there isn't much attractiveness there anyway.</p>\n"

According to McClelland, there are three types of people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Achiever, </li>\n<li>the Power/Influencer</li>\n<li>the Affiliator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these three types of people have their specific characteristics, needs, strengths and struggles, and we will talk about them briefly in this article. The characteristics that define someone in the work environment are shaped by the cultural experiences of each individual. However, the theory is not fully reflected in practice. It is very rare for someone to be a \"pure\" achiever,influencer or affiliator. Usually they are predominantly one, but also hold traits of the other.</p>\n<h2>How can we use the “Need Theory” to create an organizational culture?</h2>\n<p>We all know organizational culture. It translates what the group is and feels like. In a company (hierarchical group) Leaders, Founders and long standing team members of the company are the ones that have a strongest influence in the culture of the business. Changing one of those elements will probably change the culture of a company. The same thing if you hire or fire several people within the organization. Knowing each group element's needs, will help you understand, measure and engineer organizational culture. You can change the way your company operates, by defining a different mix between Achievers, Affiliators and Influences.

This is someone that wants to achieve goals, solve problems, have a good performance, success and make things better. They are well organised, innovative, good planners but at the same time they struggle in delegating to others, valuing relationships and team and calculating risk taking. At their best they might show Empowering Behavior and at their worst they might show a Dictatorial Behavior. The best assignment types you can give them are the ones with specific outcome targets and that provides new challenges, and typically are suited to be high level executives in large organizations. The best type of roles for an achiever are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fundraising,</li>\n<li>Administration,</li>\n<li>Training,</li>\n<li>Financial,</li>\n<li>Data gathering,</li>\n<li>Professional tasks,</li>\n<li>Board of directors,</li>\n<li>Entrepreneurship,</li>\n<li>Leadership of small task-oriented groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good example of an achiever is the CEO os Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk.</p>\n<h2>The Power/Influencer</h2>\n<img src=\"images\\articles\\motivation-types\\barack_obama.jpg\" alt=\"barack-obama\" id=\"halfimage\">\n<p>The Influencer is someone that mainly thinks about impact, influence, status and empowering others. They are good strategic thinkers, teachers/trainers and work better in hierarchy. However, they have some trouble dominating, argumenting and intimidating. At their best they might use power in an institutional manner and at their worst they might use power in a personal manner. A good assignment for them offers the opportunity to use influence and the ability to share expertise. They are not recommended for direct client service. These are the best roles for an influencer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Middle and high level management decision maker,</li>\n<li>Advocacy,</li>\n<li>Policy making,</li>\n<li>Fundraising,</li>\n<li>Political action,</li>\n<li>Speaker, trainer,</li>\n<li>Media representative</li>\n<li>Board chair.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The former president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, is an excellent example for this type.</p>\n<h2>The Affiliator</h2>\n<img src=\"images\\articles\\motivation-types\\Marge_Simpson.png\" alt=\"marge-simpson\" id=\"halfimage\">\n<p>Finally, the Affiliator is someone who thinks about interpersonal relations, their feelings, their colleagues feelings and how they can help. They are good barometer of climate at the office, good listeners and persuaders. However, they struggle dealing with conflict, have difficulty in being objective and can overreact. At their best they might display Caring Leader Behavior and at their worst they might show Pollyanna Behaviour (the need of always seeing good in everything and in everyone). For them, a good assignment are a team or people-oriented activities and relationship building activities. They usually are not managers. The best type of roles for an affiliator are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct client services,</li>\n<li>Public relations,</li>\n<li>Customer service,</li>\n<li>Support activities,</li>\n<li>Planning/giving recognition to others,</li>\n<li>Leading terms or support groups,</li>\n<li>Roles providing opportunities to socialize,</li>\n<li>Roles which offer group involvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marge Simpson is fictional character that exemplifies the influencer.</p>\n<h2>How to identify which need profile</h2>\n<p>You can identify what type your contributors are by submitting them to the <a href=\"bloomington.in.gov/media/media/application/pdf/8385.pdf\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Motivation Analysis Quiz</b></a> or you can try and identify some signals which are archetypical of each profile for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Achiever - possible clue: extensive organized smart phone,</li>\n<li>Influencer - possible clue: recognition plaque on the wall,</li>\n<li>Affiliator - possible clue: has the biggest contact list and the largest number of friends on Facebook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How can we use the “Theory of Needs” to motivate employees?</h2>\n<p>After identifying which type of “theory of need” profile you are dealing with, you can attend to their needs and keep them motivated. We will briefly going through each profile and identifying some of the most relevant needs.</p>\n<p>The achiever needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid feedback,</li>\n<li>Challenges and opportunities to improve oneself,</li>\n<li>High standarts, unique accomplishments,</li>\n<li>Deadlines,</li>\n<li>Responsability,</li>\n<li>Checklists,</li>\n<li>Likes to work alone or with other high achievers.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>The influencer needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Position of leadership and influence,</li>\n<li>Public recognition,</li>\n<li>Prestige and job status.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>The affiliator needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To help and be needed,</li>\n<li>To be with friendly people,</li>\n<li>To feel included and liked by a larger group,</li>\n<li>To be supervised by a “leader-friend”</li>\n<li>Personal recognition,</li>\n<li>Opportunities to express feelings.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2>Other stakeholders</h2>\n<p>As we said in the beginning of the article, this theory is not only helpful because of the employees. It also helps the company dealing with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer Segmentation - A product may be taillored to an achiever, affiliate or an influencer</li>\n<li>Know how to deal with suppliers and customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>In general, soft skills are important. Knowing how to read the needs of the people around us is an important skill. In this sense, this theory is another tool in your toolbelt to help you achieve your goals. You need to respect and help them fulfill their needs for them to be motivated. </p>\n"

    "html":"\n<img src=\"images\\articles\\media-press-kit\\business.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"business\">\n<h2>Press kit vs. media kit</h2>\n<p>The best way to be recognized by the press is through kits that spare journalists the trouble of having to research about your startup. There are two type of kits: media kits and press kits. The media ones are tangible, and include elementes such as postcards or brochures and the press kits are digital. Next we will dive into the ins and outs of media and Press Kits.</p>\n<h2>Media kit</h2>\n<p>The media kit is something you deliver to a journalist, in order to introduce your company and help him run articles about your business. These are the characteristics and elements that compose a Media Kit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not digital - tangible kit,</li>\n<li>Flyers - Branded and simple,</li>\n<li>Service summary - a A4 page with all the most important information about the services your startup provides,</li>\n<li>Postcards/pens/bookmarks (gifts) - something that is useful and reminds the journalist of your brand,</li>\n<li>Folder - Helps in the presentation of the kit and is one of the most visible branding elements,</li>\n<li>Stats - Try to create good impression with interesting facts and statistics about your startup,</li>\n<li>About Us - a brief paragraph where you present your business and its goal,</li>\n<li>Contact card - Creating a liaison between the journalist and the company is fundamental, include the basics like phone number, address and email,</li>\n<li>Social media accounts - always try to be explicit about all the social networks in where your business is, this way the journalists may follow your company posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Press kit</h2>\n<p>A press kit is an online page in your website where journalists can find information they want about your company.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital - online kit,</li>\n<li>History/About Us/Manifesto - a more detailed text with all the information about your company that might be interesting for the journalists,</li>\n<li>Company facts - More detailed statistics than in the Media Kit,</li>\n<li>Customer reviews - Use quotes from happy customers to improve on credibility,</li>\n<li>Logo Images - Make all your business logos available and explain how to use them,</li>\n<li>Organizational culture of the company - The culture is the be all and end all of an organization. It defines the work environment, defines how do you communicate with your customers and how does your startup makes decisions.To understand a little bit more about the company culture read our <a href=\"recruiting_startup.html\" target=\"blank\"> article about recruiting in a Startup</a>,</li>\n<li>The team - present the people behind the project,</li>\n<li>Media publications - make reference of media coverage about your company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Only Press?</h2>\n<p>The idea behind these kits, was originaly to be directed specifically for the press, television, radio. Nowadays Press should includes influencers (influential people on social networks) and bloggers as well. So you should create and send Media Kits and press Kits to both old schools press and influencers or bloggers.</p>\n<h2>Your target</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of newspapers and magazines in every country, so the first step is to filter them by themes. You should choose the ones where your business can be published and, at the same time, those who have a significant number of followers. To choose the journalists to target, two important aspects have to be taken into account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The theme that journalists talk about - if your startup is, for example, technology related, the journalists you will try to address are the ones that write about technology, not about politics, for example. Searching the newspapers for the journalists who write the most about your theme will make your efforts more effective,</li>\n<li>Journalists on social networks - Like newspaper or magazine, a journalist must have an audience on social networks and actively post information on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your target is small, it means that you can focus on them and prepare a more involving strategy, to win them over. On the other hand, if your target is large, you may need to prioritize your target.</p>\n<h2>Average vs. Outstanding</h2>\n<p>If you want to make an impact, you have to be creative. Just delivering the media kit is not enough. Your kit needs to stand out, amongst thousands of press kit and Media Kits. It has to be something original, something that makes a difference and is rememberable. You can innovate in the elements of the kit itself or in the way you deliver it or follow through. For example, here at Idea Ninja, we could contract an actor to dress up as a Ninja and make him deliver our kit. The journalist would never forget that an actual Ninja delivered the kit and will definitely be curious about it. For the press kits is more difficult to innovate, because it is an online page. However you can always find ways to make it more interactive and interesting. For example, making a video presenting your business to complement the written information. These first impressions are important to develop a relation with the journalists. If they are impressed, you will be covered by the media, allowing for “free” publicity.</p>\n<h2>How do you get louder?</h2>\n<p>Unlike a press kit, a Media Kit is active. So you must try to use it to approach the Media and spread your word of mouth. You can deliver your kit in hand (example: in an event that you know will be covered by media), send it by mail. The more you spread your kit, the more likely you are to be covered. But this is only the start. After you have created a relationship with a journalist you need to continue interacting with them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare and use press release often with relevant and entertaining information,</li>\n<li>Ask feedback,</li>\n<li>Engage in a conversation about the future of your company and the industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Kit distribution - Locally vs. Globally</h2>\n<p>The media kits are costly, so you need to define a clear target. There are two strategy when it comes to approach Media. You either do it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Locally - if you’re not sure you’ll have success, start with a small target, locally. Being local and small makes it easier to get feedback and improve Kits. Furthermore doing it locally and small is cheaper,</li>\n<li>Globally - If you want to go big immediately and it doesn’t matter how effective your are, go global. It will cost you more, but you will reach many more journalists.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Although the Global option increases the chances of having more media coverage, here at Idea Ninja, we suggest you first try doing it locally and tune your kit. Only after improving the effectiveness of the kit, should you go global.</p>\n<h2>Relationship with Media</h2>\n<p>Engaging the Media is an art form. You should promote proximity, but also be aware that the media can make it or break your reputation. In the case of something backfiring, it will be much easier to manage if you have a good relationship with the journalists, bloggers and influencers than, if you have no relationship at all. Creating, promoting and maintaining good relationship with the media, is one of your biggest challenges.</p>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>Having the Media on your side makes your life a lot easier as an entrepreneur. Making it easy for Journalists to talk about your brand is very important in developing a good relation with the press. To develop a good relationship we advise you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have both kits: press and media kit,</li>\n<li>Share them with the press, and also with influencers and blogs,</li>\n<li>Have an original Media Kit,</li>\n<li>Choose between a local or global distribution strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "html": "\n<h2>The growing importance of Youtube</h2>\n<p>The number of hours of video seen on youtube has been growing by more than 50% (2015 vs. 2016). This increase of importance is related to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher bandwidth, allows you to watch higher quality videos without lag,</li>\n<li>Content consumption simplicity. Video continues to be the simplest format to consume information.</li>\n<li>Media richness. Video is a richer medium, when compared with articles or photos or audio, because you have visual and audio comunication put together to deliver both verbal and nonverbal messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"images\\articles\\youtube_channel\\youtube.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"youtube\">\n<h2>Marketers ruined it all</h2>\n<p>What started out as a platform where anyone could share their videos and have fun doing so, became one of the biggest business in the world. Vlogs, unboxing videos, how-to/tutorials and timelapse videos are some of the most popular videos right now. Others use it as a way to complement to the content they have on their websites. They are used not just by individuals, but also by companies to advertise (through ads) or by creating content and monetizing it (taking adds into their videos).</p>\n<h2>Why do people watch Youtube</h2>\n<p>Every day people watch hundreds of millions of hours on youtube.These are two of the reasons why most people resort to youtube:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entertainment - When you're bored, you search for entertaining videos,</li>\n<li>Learn - searching for a tutorial or relevant information on the subject.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your videos should satisfy at least one of these two needs. If they are good, people will share them.</p>\n<h2>Becoming a Vlogger</h2>\n<p>For a business, there are many reasons why you should start vloging. You wouldn’t even consider not having a facebook page, in order to generate awareness to your brand and facilitate sales, so you should also use the potential that youtube offers. Nowadays making videos is not as hard as you might expect, but before that there are other tasks that need your attention. Here is how to start.</p>\n<h2>1st step: create a channel</h2>\n<p>It's really important for you to understand that you should create a brand and not just a youtube channel. And why is that? You want to be able to interact with your target as a brand. A brand allows you to expand beyond youtube and use multiple channels to generate awareness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other social media,</li>\n<li>Website/blog,</li>\n<li>Event participation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, creating a branded youtube channel requires time to dedicate to these topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theme selection,</li>\n<li>Concept development,</li>\n<li>Interaction on social media,</li>\n<li>Algorithm optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Theme selection</h2>\n<p>Regarding the theme that you should choose for your channel or your videos, there is a duality: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can either decide to talk about something that has a very large audience and very strong competition,</li>\n<li>or a smaller audience, but with a trending subject with little to no competition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you chose to face the big guns in the market you will have a very hard time. But at the same time the payoff is immense. If you chose to go small, be aware that you may have difficulty moving out of that niche and asserting yourselves in different topic.</p>\n<p>If you want to cause an impact, your theme must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear,</li>\n<li>interesting,</li>\n<li>have a big enough audience,</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Concept development</h2>\n<p>Every youtube channel needs a concept. You need to develop an idea for the channel that will translate itself to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview,</li>\n<li>Aesthetic concept,</li>\n<li>Playlists,</li>\n<li>Humorous/entertaining note,</li>\n<li>Structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interaction on social media</h2>\n<p>Nowadays there are many social networks at our disposal, so we can try to make the most of them, as far as sharing our content is concerned. Try to share your videos and your channels in all social networks. If someone comment your posts, interact with them as much as you can, because this will make them feel that they are contributing to the channel and being part of the brand. Let them suggest content for new videos and respect their opinions. Overall, try to always be in touch with viewers. And finally, try to collaborate with other channels. It will direct users from their channel to yours and vice versa, giving you both more viewers and subscribers.</p>\n<h2>Algorithm Optimization</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pace - Frequency that you launch new content in your channel,</li>\n<li>Metadata -title, description, tags and thumbnails are important, because in early stages youtube depends on them to rank your video and understand the main topics behind it,</li>\n<li>Recency - when you search for videos on youtube, it will present you first the ones that are more recent,</li>\n<li>Watch time - Although the time a user watches a video is important, it is even more important the session watch time, which is the time the user will watch your video, plus all the other watched during the same session. So having a follow through strategy is paramount,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From time to time, try to take a look at previews videos using youtube analytics, study the results of your video and try to introduce new changes (vary on video length, change tagwords, etc) to optimize the results</p>\n<h2>2nd step: The videos</h2>\n<p>Once you have created a channel and the concept is developed, we can start producing. There are two very important processes in this production: capture and editing. If you want to know more about <a href=\"How-to-make-easy-videos.html\" target=\"blank\">how to make easy videos, read our article</a>.There are several softwares to help you allong the way, and we'll give you some good examples.</p>\n<h2>Screen Capture Solutions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CamStudio (Windows) - Free</li>\n<li>QuickTime (Mac) - Free</li>\n<li>Camtasia Studio (Windows, Mac) - Paid</li>\n<li>ScreenFlow (Mac) - Paid</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Video Editing Solutions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Movie Maker (Windows) - Free</li>\n<li>iMovie (Mac) - Free</li>\n<li>Camtasia (Mac, Windows) - Paid</li>\n<li>ScreenFlow (Mac) - Paid</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Structure of the video</h2>\n<p>The videos you put out should be immediately recognizable as yours. This means that you must create an identity, in your videos, and apply the same structure for all of them. Here is an example of a stratucture commonly found in youtube:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the hook,</li>\n<li>Introduction,</li>\n<li>Main content,</li>\n<li>Intro out/conclusion/final remarks,</li>\n<li>Subscribe and other videos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some videos only have the introduction, development and conclusion, but the setting the hook and subscribe and other videos are important for increasing the views of the video. Setting the hook, defines the expectations of what the video will be about and what to expect from it, reducing the bounce rate along the video. The subscribe and other videos allows for increasing your viewers base and generate a higher total view time.</p>\n<h2>How to keep increasing views and subscribers</h2>\n<p>In order to increase your views and subscribers, you need to keep a steady pace of posting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post, at least, one video in every two weeks,</li>\n<li>Aim for 5 minutes vídeos (Lately Youtube seems to be pushing fo longer videos),</li>\n<li>Focus on making an awesome thumbnail,</li>\n<li>Keep in mind that is very important to add the most watchtime in the first week as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>Given the importance that youtube has today, we need to realize how can we use youtube to grow our business. However, as any socialmedia algorithm, Youtube’s algorithm is always undergoing minor adjustments, so we have to keep up to date.

    "html": "\n<h2>Why are videos relevant in a website?</h2>\n<p>I think we speak for most people when we say that people in general prefer to watch a video than read. When it comes to the choice between a video and an article, the video usually wins. And why is that? Because videos require less effort from the part of the person who is watching them and don't take as long as the article takes to read. So, to follow the trend and gain traffic try to add this type of content to your website. Find out more about <a href=\"How-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-SEO.html\" target=\"blank\">driving traffic to your website</a> in our article</p>\n<img src=\"images\\articles\\easy-video\\filming_video.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Filming Video\">\n<h2>The goals you should set for your videos</h2>\n<p>Before you make a video, you need to decide which one of these three goals you will set for it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>capture traffic to your website </li>\n<li>create a tutorial for a product/service</li>\n<li>sell your product/service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you've set your goal you will decide which type of video best fits it.</p>\n<h2>Different types of videos</h2>\n<p>Throughout the internet we can see three types of videos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheap and small production videos - They never aim to generate traffic to a website, but to complement the website articles, serve as tutorials, etc. So, for this type of videos, you must have content already . Find out how to write articles for the web <a href=\"How-to-write-article-for-the-web.html\" target=\"blank\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Average productions videos - For these type of videos, you need to make an investment ranging from € 2,000 to € 5,000. Each video will take an average of 10 hours to be made and you will need to publish about 10 videos per month. However, in order for the investment to pay off, each video must have approximately 12,000 views.</li>\n<li>Big productions videos - These are videos that have a way of reaching the public totally different from the other two and in which the budgets much deeper pockets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Big production videos</h2>\n<p>These kind of videos are, for example, the movies we watch on cinema, series, tv shows, and so on. Although they are very good videos, they have some disadvantages for those who are thinking about starting a business. First, they are really expensive and require a large investment in material so that the final result is no less than excellent. Then, you can't film everything inside, you also need outside spaces to shoot. The spaces need to be meticulously sought out and then reserved, which takes up a lot of time and sometimes, also money. Choosing the right actors is another crucial factor. The casting process is something that takes time, and spends lots of money. And finally, the professional editing, which can not be done by anyone, but by someone with qualifications for such. And it has to be a team, it can not be a lonely person. It also takes a lot of time. So, although it's the best kind of video that we can present to your target audience, it requires a very large stake from the startup.</p>\n<p>Example: Roadkill</p>\n<div class=\"out_vid\">\n<div class=\"art_vid\">\n<iframe class=\"vid\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDK86kzgUPg\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDK86kzgUPg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Average production videos</h2>\n<p>These are also good videos but that don't need so much material and space. This type of content may already be the ideal for your business, however it still costs some money. First, you need to bet on lightning. If you don't have the necessary light to film it, it will not have good quality. Even if you do not have to invest in a lot of material, make sure that what you have is of good quality. You often still need more than one camera to this type of videos. And finally you need to choose wisely the room where the video will be recorded. You need to take into account some factors, such as the echo and some other acoustic aspects.</p>\n<p>Example: The Random Show</p>\n<div class=\"out_vid\">\n<div class=\"art_vid\">\n<iframe class=\"vid\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPleJbpqbwc\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPleJbpqbwc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Cheap and small production videos</h2>\n<p>These are the easiest of them all and we will focus a bit on these. There are three basic steps to create a cheap and small video:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrative</li>\n<li>Screen capture</li>\n<li>Audio capture</li>\n<li>Edition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, let's deepen in each of these three steps.</p>\n<p>example: Article writing tool tutorial </p>\n<div class=\"out_vid\">\n<div class=\"art_vid\">\n<iframe class=\"vid\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RK2NjeoEp9I\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RK2NjeoEp9I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Narrative</h2>\n<p>The narrative you develop must be colloquial and really work well in a video scenario. Here at IdeaNinja we are used to work with Google Presentations because is easy and accessible to everyone. However, there are many others to choose from. To make the video more interesting, you can add icons to your presentation. In <a href=\"http://iconmonstr.com\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">iconmonster</a>, the icons are free and you can search exactly what you are looking for. If you want to add images check out our <a href=\"Improve-your-website-design-free-photos.html\" target=\"blank\">article</a>. You also need to make sure you are making the screen capture in 16:9, or the image will be cutted.</p>\n<h2>Screen capture</h2>\n<p>After your narrative is written, it's important to have a chosen program to present the video's theme. To capture the presentation you create, there are many applications to capture the screen, for example Fraps, but we use one called Camstudio, which is free and very easy to use.</p>\n<h2>Audio capture</h2>\n<p>The audio in a video is very important, so you need to make sure it's well recorded. There are two types of setup to record audio for this kind of content You can use a USB sound board with a microphone or just connect a good microphone with an usb connection. To edit the sound you have lots of programs. We can recommend you Reaper if you have windows or Garageband if you have a MacOS.</p>\n<h2>Edition</h2>\n<p>This is the part that probably takes more time, however, if you choose an easy program to edit, it'll be faster. We will give you some quick tips to help you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to first measure the time of the audio, then making the screen capture,</li>\n<li>Split the audio and video in small pieces to make it easier to synchronize the two,</li>\n<li>Try to make the audio and the image sound natural and don't worry about silences, sometimes they are needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on your editing level skill you can go from something as simple as movie maker or imovie to Avid media composer.</p>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>To conclude, it's important that you realize that videos are very important to startups, even if they only serve as a support for articles or as tutorials.</p>\n<p>Here are some final remarks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set goals to your video,</li>\n<li>Choose the kind of video that most fits your goal (big production videos, average production videos or cheap and small production videos),</li>\n<li>When it comes to cheap and small production videos, do not skip any of these steps: Narrative, screen capture, audio capture and edition.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "html": "\n<h2>What is SEO</h2>\n<p>There are over 47 billion websites available on the Internet, an average of more than 6 pages per person. It's a lot. With these numbers, search engines needed to find a way to rank the pages in a given search result and make sure people would find useful and trustworthy information on the web. For that, they created an algorithm to rank webpages. As soon as this algorithm was created, companies tried to crack it, in order to understand how they could reach the top of the search results page. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the area of knowledge dedicated to the improvement of a website’s position in the search results page. The pages with higher SEO score, have a better position in Google's results pages. There are several rules Google uses to evaluate web pages and has put forward guidelines with best practices.</p>\n<div class=\"out_vid\">\n<div class=\"art_vid\">\n<iframe class=\"vid\" height=\"auto\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsBsmERDMkk\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsBsmERDMkk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Page authority</h2>\n<p>Google created an algorithm named Page Authority to attribute a score to a webpage, and although the score of each page is kept secret by Google and other search engines, we know that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This score goes from 1 to 99, being 99 the best score possible,</li>\n<li>To determine page authority, Google takes into account two kinds of variables: Internal and External factors,</li>\n<li>To calculate page authority they multiply the two groups of factors (Internal and External).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the years, information on Google’s algorithm was leaked and deducted from empiric knowledge. Nowadays there are several online services that provide you information on your page authority score. Although some of those services are pretty accurate, none of them can claim to be 100% right. We advise you to use these services, to get a sense of where your website stands, but take the data with a pinch of salt. It is absolutely paramount that you keep track of how Google looks at you, and you should do it using their <a href=\"https://www.Google.com/webmasters/tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"blank\">webmaster tools</a>.</p>\n<h2>Internal vs External factors</h2>\n<p>In the internal factors of a page Google tries to appraise the quality of its contents. They are divided into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed of the page,</li>\n<li>Depth of content,</li>\n<li>Adherence to Google guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The external factors are exclusively related to the amount of backlinks a page has. The rationale behind it is that a good webpage is referenced by others. Backlinks are measured by the amount of times a page is referred in other pages through links. Because page authority results from the multiplication of Internal and External factors you should take both under consideration. A low score in one of them will undermine your efforts in the other factor (example: If a page has a great amount of backlinks but poor content, the result is a low page authority and vice versa).</p>\n<h2>What are Backlinks</h2>\n<p>Although all links are useful, not all of them will help your page improve its page authority score. Links from other sites are always a good source of traffic. However to add score to your page authority they must not be rel=”nofollow”. You can check this out by inspecting the element of the link:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A link is not useful when their reference to your page is rel=nofollow, as you can see in the picture. We can save you some time and tell you that all social media pages are rel=nofollow, and therefore useless as a backlink. This means that every share of a website page you make on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc, adds nothing to your website’s page authority.</li>\n<li>A backlink counts if the link is not rel=nofollow. When you inspect the element, as you can notice by observing the second picture, and the rel=”nofollow” attribute is not present then the link is adding score to the page.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"images/articles/basics_seo/nofollow.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"baclink nofollow link\">\n<img src=\"images/articles/basics_seo/follow.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"baclink follow link\">\n<p>The better the page that references you, or the higher is the page authority, the more score it adds to your page. So, how do you find out the amount of score a link can give you? There are several providers of backlinks analysers out there that will help you make this assessment. At the moment, we rather not recommend any specific one, but we do suggest you use one.</p>\n<h2>How to get backlinks - important tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The key to get high quality backlinks is to focus on getting an effective Marketing strategy to your pages, rather than using endless schemes that won't lead you far.</li>\n<li>Create a blog associated with your page. For instance, if you sell doorbells the only goal of your website is to be a sales page to your product. You may have a hard time getting other pages to backlink your website. You can turn things around if you create a blog with useful information about doorbells and their importance in safety with frequent questions about them. This way the goal of your blog is to become the most significant source of information about doorbells in the web, gathering links from all websites related to the subject. Once you build a strong score on your blog you can link to your webpage, not only directing traffic, but also adding score to your webpage. If indeed your blog becomes the biggest authority in the web regarding doorbells, and your website is frequently referenced by the blog, then the top 2 pages in Google search on keywords related to doorbells will be yours.</li>\n<li>Get your partners to link you from their website. Don’t forget to ask them to link to your website. This is basic and usually forgotten.</li>\n<li>Get a strategy to appear on media. Doing something outside the box will be an attention grabber. The media will take interest. (example: build a statue out of doorbells). </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Page speed</h2>\n<p>Does your page take more than 1.5 seconds to load? If your answer is yes, then your page is slower than recommended and you should analyse what is affecting your page speed. Your page speed can be influenced by several factors, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large images - optimize your images in order to reduce their size. You shouldn’t put a 5000px wide photo in a 1300px wide page, instead reduce its size to fit. Try not to exceed 200kb per photo. And if you have many photos in a page, try to go under 100Kb for each photo.</li>\n<li>Unminified HTML CSS and JS files – Minification is a process used to reduce a file size, by getting rid of spaces and other useless junk. You should minify files to reduce their size.</li>\n<li>High latency - your page response time can be improved by using a CDN. To find out more read this article on <a href=\"performance-why-use-CDN.html\" target=\"blank\">website performance and why you should use a CDN</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Content depth</h2>\n<p>Google values pages whose content shows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Depth - A page with less than 500 words has a low evaluation by Google because is depicted as irrelevant.</li>\n<li>Scannability - You should make your pages scannable. This means you need to write content having that in mind.</li>\n<li>Other media - Last but not least, you should use images, videos and links on your articles as much as possible. Remember to tag your images in HTML, through alt-tag them, to provide text description accessible to search engines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these aspects define what is considered as useful content by Google. To learn <a href=\"How-to-write-article-for-the-web.html\" target=\"blank\">how to write an article for the web read here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Google Guidelines</h2>\n<p>To optimize the information internet users search for, Google has to crawl through all webpages and score them. In that process, Google has a way of filtering all kind of webpages to find out which are legit. So they created a set of guidelines with best basic SEO practices that Google recommends. The violation of those guidelines can result in a lower page authority score or even the removal of a webpage from Googles' search results. Some of the most penalised acts from Google are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inappropriate use of syndicated content - they check if your page is using copied content. If so, your page is highly penalized and can be removed,</li>\n<li>Wrong use of pages with affiliates - pages with contributors are only good if they have original reviews. Google has a way to know if a page has original comments,</li>\n<li>Doorway pages - their only goal is to lead users to another page and therefore they are considered poor quality pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another aspect to consider related to Google guidelines is the usability of your website, not only on desktops but also on mobiles. If you make it easy to find anything in your page, that is a sign of good usability. A page with good usability allows their users to have a good experience visiting your page. Optimized pages for mobile have a higher score by Google. Google prizes that and makes them appear on a better place in the search results page when using those devices.</p>\n<p>More information on <a href=\"https://support.Google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google's guidelines can be found in their website</a>. If you have a new website, you should look deep into these basic SEO Practices and make sure your pages follow them basic rules.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/basics_seo/crtl.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Google Guidelines best practices\">\n<h2>Final remarks</h2>\n<p>The best strategy to put your website on the map is to have valuable content on your pages and trustworthy backlinks.</p>\n<p>Our last advice on this is to have white hat SEO practices (legit and organic practices, result of an effective Marketing strategy) instead of black hat ones (i.e. buying backlinks, or anything against Google’s guidelines). These black hat SEO practices can lead to exclusion of Google's search page and it is just not worth the risk. You want to have lots of free traffic to your website, so the more you follow the rules the better your pages’ position in search results will be.</p>\n<p>We also advise you to add your website in Google’s webmaster tools, and get access to your free <a href=\"https://www.Google.com/webmasters/tools/home\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">search console</a>. In here you can track the SEO performance of your pages.

If you have a page on facebook, you will see on the bottom of the post something like: 1000 people reach. This indicates that the post has been presented in the timeline of 1000 people. </p>\n<h2>How does Facebook decide what reach your post gets</h2>\n<p>There are more than 5 billion posts shared everyday. Therefore, Facebook needed to find a way to prioritize the posts that viewers actually care about. So they decided to create Edgerank formula. Edgerank is the Facebook algorithm whose goal is to pursuit news feed optimization. The formula is a sum of all the interactions (Edges) generated by your posts or shares. An edge can be any kind of activity on Facebook, from a status update to a comment, a share, a tag or a new like.</p>\n<h2>How is edgerank formula calculated</h2>\n<p>The Edgerank formula has into account three variables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the affinity score,</li>\n<li>the weight of each edge,</li>\n<li>the time decay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each variable has a different score. Although Facebook does not disclose the score it has attributed to each edge, empiric data that has been collected made it possible to make a few assumptions.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/improve_post_reach/Edgerank_formula.png\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Edgerank formula affinity edge decay\">\n<h2>What is affinity - u</h2>\n<p>The affinity score between the viewer and the edge creator measures how close you are with the person who made the post. The more interactions you have with that person (i.e. likes, shares, comments, ...), the higher the score will be. This works both ways: likes from you to that person and likes from that person to you. Shares tend to have a higher score and show more interaction than simple likes. Moreover, shares increase the chance for more interaction on your post, because it has the possibility to reach more users. If your posts are not having the desired reach, it may be because you're not having enough interactions with your followers/friends. Start by finding a way to make people take action and actually interact with your posts.</p>\n<h2>Weight of the edge - w</h2>\n<p>Edgerank does not attribute the same value to all kind of contents. The weight is measured depending on the post kind. Posting photos or videos tends to be more valued by Facebook than link posts. Hence, Facebook attributes more edgerank for video and photo than a link post. When you post a video, Facebook not only takes in consideration how many people like your video but also for how long they watched it or if they turned on the sound. That is why content like videos have more weight. People don't always have to share, like or comment to show interest. It's the amount of interaction that count. The same with photos. If a person opens a photo to take a better look, edgerank takes it as a sign of interest and will give it more score.</p>\n<h2>Time decay - d</h2>\n<p>This factor is related with the age of a post. In other words, it is measured by how long ago the edge was created. As the post gets older, it is more likely that it has lost importance to the viewers, or because it has already been seen or because it is just not relevant anymore. The truth is that posts on Facebook tend to last, on average, three hours before disappearing from news feed. However, the more attractive the post is, the more chances it has to last. There are ways to boost organically the time decay of a post, like sharing it and keeping the engagement alive. But our advice is to focus on updating your page with fresh content.</p>\n<h2>Top tips to improve edgerank score</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be consistent - start posting quality content regularly, ideally at least once a day.</li>\n<li>Keep updating your page with new material - it is crucial to keep your page fresh.</li>\n<li>Schedule your posts accordingly with your target - choose the posting time according to your target audience, and try to match it with your target active time on Facebook. By checking the Insights/Posts of your Facebook page you can analyze at what time your Fans are online.</li>\n<li>Promote interaction with your posts - don't be afraid to ask for likes, shares or people's opinions. Also respond to every comment made to your post, since it will generate more interaction, hence a greater edgerank.</li>\n<li>Give priority to photos and videos - as we explained before, these type of contents have a higher score on edgerank and will conquer your viewers more easily.</li>\n<li>Avoid deleting posts - everytime you delete a post, your edgerank decreases. Of course everyone makes mistakes. However it is preferable to double check every post, share or comment before making it public, then deleting it.</li>\n<li>Share valuable content - it doesn't matter if it is a link from another page or a link of your own, share fresh and interesting content. It will keep your viewers interested, it will make them interact more and thus increase your edgerank.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>There is no way to be sure what will really improve your edgerank score, since the news feed algorithm is a Facebook secret. However, Facebook is always making adjustments to make sure viewers get access to the stories they are really interested in. They announce those updates in the <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/category/news-feed-fyi/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook blog</a>, and from time to time we advise you to take a look into the latest updates in this blog. The most important advice we can give you is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always post content that will generate engagement,</li>\n<li>Keep posting at a regular rate,</li>\n<li>Try to improve interaction with your followers to get a higher affinity score.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "html": "\n<p>Driving traffic to your website (<a href=\"How-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-SEO.html\" target=\"blank\">How to drive traffic to your website - SEO</a>) is probably one of the biggest Marketing challenges you have on your startup to-do list. Writing articles (<a href=\"How-to-write-article-for-the-web.html\" target=\"blank\">How to write an article for the web</a>) can go a long way. Besides that, <strong>accounting for entrepreneurs</strong> is a very important topic to be sure that your company will not go bankrupt</p>\n<h2>The business and the entrepreneur</h2>\n<p>The first basic concept you need to grasp is that you and your company are two different entities. Think of your business as another person. It has its own resources, debts, income and costs, its own needs. Very often owners think of the business numbers as their own, and they are clearly not the same.</p>\n<h2>Cost based accounting</h2>\n<p>The second basic concept you need to understand is that your assets will be valued based on their costs. Not on their commercial value. For instance, if you have a grocery shop and you order cookies at 50 cents a package and retail it for 1$, the value registered in your account will be the 50 cents. Not the 1$. There are other issues that influence its value, like amortization and depreciation, but we will talk about those later on.</p>\n<h2>Transaction based accounting</h2>\n<p>Third basic concept is that in the income statement and the balance sheet, changes happen when the transaction take place and not when the good and money are exchanged, more precisely, when you receive or send a receipt. That constitutes a transaction. Later on, when the payment is made, the cashflow will be affected, because the cashflow statement follows cash events and not transaction based events.</p>\n<h2>Documents produced from accounting</h2>\n<p>There are three main documents that are produced from accounting: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Balance Sheet - a photography of your business financials in a given moment, where you can see what your company owns and owes,</li>\n<li>Income statement - the income statement which describes how well did you do in a period of time, usually a year, and it relates to revenues and costs,</li>\n<li>Cashflow Statement - the cashflow statement describes the flow of cash during a period of time. It allows you to understand:\n<ol>\n<li>Where your cash came from</li>\n<li>How your cash was spent</li>\n<li>If your cash status has improved</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will be showing you examples of these documents so that you can go along as we explain them.</p>\n<h2>Balance sheet</h2>\n<p>A balance sheet has two major groups divided into columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assets (on the left side) - it states all that your company owns,</li>\n<li>Equity and Liabilities (on the right side) - in plain terms, it states where the money, to acquire what the company owns, came from.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"images/articles/accounting-entrepreneurs/balancesheet.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"balance sheet example\" style=\"width:800px ; margin-right:100px; margin-left:100px\">\n<p>The total amount in the left side, Assets, should always be equal to the total amount on the right side, Equity and Liabilities.</p>\n<p>The right side itself is divided in two major groups: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liabilities - is what your company owes (to yourself included),</li>\n<li>Equity - is basically the remainder between what the companies owns and what it owes. Equity should not be confused with the value of the company, because of the very nature of accounting being a cost based system and not a value based system. But let's say you do not want to be negative on equity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cost vs Investment vs Paying debt vs Revenue</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it's hard to understand the difference between Cost, Investment, Paying debt and revenue. Basically putted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost is when some asset is consumed, you lose its value and you are not paying debt. For instance, when you pay salaries, or electricity bills, you spend an asset: cash.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When you are paying debt, you are also removing an asset (cash) from your balance sheet, but at the same time and for the same amount you are reducing your liabilities.</li>\n<li>In an investment you are exchanging an asset for another asset of the same value. For instance when you buy a 700$ computer, you subtract 700$ from cash, but at the same time you now own a 700$ computer that will be registered in your asset side of the balance sheet (tangible assets).</li>\n<li>Revenue is when you sell something and here there are two scenarios:<ol>\n<li>Products - Selling a product you will sell something that is registered in your balance sheet and that is a cost, but at the same time you will be adding cash to your asset side (note that if you are doing things right and selling at a profit, you should be adding more than removing).</li>\n<li>Services - When selling a service you aren't removing any asset, only adding cash.</li>\n</ol> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, if you remember, in the top of paragraph we stated that the two sides of the balance sheet should always have the same amount. However now we have increased on the left side. So what happens on the right side to compensate it?</p>\n<h2>Income statement and Equity</h2>\n<p>The income statement reflects if you are profitable or not. If you are profitable, it basically means that in your balance sheet assets minus liabilities has become more positive. So there is direct connection between income statement that the balance sheet and it is place inside the equity. It is called retained earnings.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/accounting-entrepreneurs/incomestatement.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"income statement example\" style=\"width:289px ; margin:20px\">\n<p>In the income statement itself you register Revenues, and the costs of goods sold. Costs of goods sold might be a product or service you have acquired in order to resell it.</p>\n<p>So now if you subtract costs of good sold to the revenue you will reach gross profit.</p>\n<p>After gross profits, you register all other operational expenses, like salaries, electricity bills, etc. Within operational expenses, you should include depreciation and amortization. Then you calculate your operational income by applying the following formula:</p>\n<br>\n<p>Operational income = Gross profit - Operational expenses.</p>\n<br>\n<p>To calculate your income from financing, add financial revenue (example: interests you earn on deposits) and subtract all your financial costs (example: interests you have to pay on your loans).</p>\n<p>After that, you calculate your Net Earnings before taxes applying the following formula:</p>\n<br>\n<p>Net Earnings before taxes = Operating income + Income from financing</p>\n<br>\n<p>Now you deduct your taxes and finally you reach the end result: Net Income. </p>\n<h2>Depreciation, Amortization and interests</h2>\n<p>When you ask a loan for 100k, you register on your balance sheet that value into your liabilities, but not the interests. Interest are a cost that is related to your yearly expenses and they affect your income statement directly.</p>\n<p>Depreciation and amortization are probably the hardest concept to grasp in accounting so, let's try to demystify them. Let's say your business buys a car for 15K, so you get an asset named car that is valued in 15K. However, next year the car isn't valued at 15K anymore and the way that is translated into accounting is through depreciation. Basically, your car value will be depreciated at a rate defined by the government and that depreciation is accounted as a cost and subtracts on the balance sheet. Amortization is similar, but while depreciation applies itself to tangible assets (like cars, flats, machines), amortization applies to intangible assets (like domains, franchising agreements, pictures, films, etc).</p>\n<h2>Cashflow statement</h2>\n<p>This statement in some countries is not mandatory. But because the main goal of a company should be to create free cashflow (dividend + investment), and many companies fail to manage their cash effectively, we will talk briefly about it. As the name indicates, it refers to the flow of cash inside a company. There are two methods to calculate cashflow: the direct and the indirect method. We will focus in the indirect method, that is in our opinion easier to understand. The rationale behind it, is to start with your income statement and then work from there to create a cash based system.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/accounting-entrepreneurs/cashflowstatement.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"cashflow statement example\" style=\"width:540px ; margin-right:230px; margin-left:230px\">\n<p>Here is the process:</p>\n<p>Basically, the process is that, when you calculate your net income you include costs that are not cash based, like amortization and depreciation. So the first thing you do is removing that effect by adding them to your income statement.</p>\n<p>Another difference is that cashflow is a cashed based system, in opposition to the income statement which is a transaction based system. So, there is a difference between issuing a receipt for your services and getting payed. As well as purchasing a product or service and paying for it. When you issue a receipt you are making the sale and, as such, it appears in your income statement. During the period that goes between the transaction and the payment the value either goes, in your balance sheet, to account receivables (liability) or account payable (assets) depending if you owe or if your clients owe you.</p>\n<p>To reach your net cashflow from operating activities you need to use the following formula:</p>\n<br>\n<p>Net income + Amortization + Depreciation + Difference in accounts payable - Difference in accounts receivable - Difference in inventory </p>\n<br>\n<p>Then you calculate your company's Net Cash flow from investing activities. So you add up all your investments and capital expenditures. Each investment is money leaving the company and, as such, it should have a negative value. On the other hand, any time you sell an asset that was an investment you register that inflow of cash as positive.</p>\n<p>Finally, you get to financing activities and here you subtract any outgoing flow of cash like dividends, or paid loans, and add any new loans and capital increases since it represents an inflow of cash. Now to finish, and to calculate if you business has now more cash or less cash than it did in the previous period, you apply the following formula:</p>\n<br>\n<p>Net Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents = Net cash from operating activities + Net Cash from investing activities + Net cash flow from financing activities.</p>\n<br>\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<p>We recommend you to get a good accountant and try to understand thoroughly your accounting documents. They will give you some valuable information of how your company is doing. Although it is not what we would recommended as a dashboard for your company, it offers valuable insights and it will help you make decisions.</p>\n"

    "html": "\n<h2>Basics of Idea Evaluation</h2>\n<p>Let's start with the basics.&nbsp;For an idea to be good enough for you to make the investment to start a company, it needs to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a good market,</li>\n<li>Have a good market fit,</li>\n<li>Have a competitive advantage,</li>\n<li>Have a good growth potential,</li>\n<li>You must be able to overcome barriers to enter efficiently.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of the above topics matter.&nbsp;So you should score your idea in every one of those topics (you can score them on a scale of 1 to 5) and then apply the following formula:</p>\n<p>(Market x Market fit x Competitive advantage x Growth potential)/Cost of barriers to enter</p>\n<h2>Market Evaluation</h2>\n<p>Every time you think about a market you should think about: Value, Growth, and Margin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Value translates itself on how large the market is (in value),</li>\n<li>Growth is about how fast that market is growing (%),</li>\n<li>Margin is about how large are the margins of that service or product.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you don't have values on the market size, growth or margins, try to evaluate qualitatively based on your experience. Then, multiply the three of them to summarize that information into one number. Remember, the total Market evaluation number should be between 1 and 5.\n</p>\n<h2>Market Fit</h2>\n<p>Market fit translates basically into the market willing to pay what you are asking for your product or service you intend to offer.&nbsp;If they do, it basically means that you got it right.&nbsp;You need to clearly identify this point because this is a really big assumption to make.&nbsp;Our advice is to go out and ask the market what would they be willing to pay for your offer. Then see if your idea is profitable for a specific price point.&nbsp;Then, see if your idea is profitable for a specific price point, and so, give a score and plug it into the formula.</p>\n<h2>Competitive Advantage</h2>\n<p>Jack Welch, a legend in Management and former CEO of GE, said \"<i>if you don't have a competitive Advantage do not compete</i>\" and that is absolutely true.&nbsp;A competitive advantage translates itself into: the ability you have of offering a product or service at a specific price point, sold in your distribution channels with your advertising efforts and have your clients choosing your solution rather than a competitor.&nbsp;It needs to be relevant to the market.&nbsp;There are <b>3 types of competitive advantages</b>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cost Advantage - where your cost structure allows you to offer a lower price point than other competitors (or the same price point but you can invest more than your competitors in customer acquisition like advertisement),</li>\n<li>Differentiation - where your product is better than your competitors, being the best choice for your customers,</li>\n<li>Focus - where your product is better in a specific niche.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Know what your competitive advantage is and press on it. Produce a score for your competitor advantage and plug it in the formula.</p>\n<h2>Growth potential</h2>\n<p>Is there growth potential in your startup idea?&nbsp;So, can you move into new markets, upsell or make your market grow?&nbsp;How and by how much?&nbsp;Score your growth potential and plug it in the formula.</p>\n<h2>Barriers to Enter</h2>\n<p>Barriers to enter are the hurdles, efforts that you have to go through to start selling and deliver your product or service.&nbsp;The larger the barriers to enter, the more protected your margins will be.&nbsp;The ability to enter the market without having to pay full price on those entrance barriers is what you are looking for.&nbsp;To do that you need to have the right skill set, the tools and capital.&nbsp;So, identifying the task you need to execute is paramount to fully understand how much does it cost you to enter that market.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/value-idea/value_idea_photo.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Startup or small business idea value\">\n<h2>Score an good or bad Idea</h2>\n<p>You just have gone through the process and came up to a final score for your idea. There are no definitive conclusion and you should always review your assumptions.&nbsp;However, a good rule of thumb (if you rated each item on a scale of 1 to 5 and applied the formula) is above 100 score, it shows some potential and you should look deeper into the idea.&nbsp;Above 150, you should test your idea as soon as possible&nbsp;Above 250, you should really dig deep and find a way to build your startup.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Your idea can be in a small and stagnant market and still be very good because the quality or efficiency of your execution will drive customer towards your business, providing you with lower barriers to enter and good competitive advantage.&nbsp;On the other hand, you may not have the full skill set to execute your business, but your market fit and your market size is so good that you can outsource parts of your business.&nbsp;You should not disassociate the idea with the execution, because it is crucial to understand your ability to execute that idea. For example, starting a restaurant in midtown Manhattan to sell pizza might be the right thing for your, but it isn't for us (we're lousy cookers and know nothing about the business of managing a restaurant).</p>\n<p>If you like your idea and want to start pitching it, take a look into this tool and article on pitches: <a href=\"automatic_pitch_machine.html\">Automatic Pitch Machine</a> and <a href=\"perfect_pitch.html\"> Perfect Pitch</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, if you are looking to start a business using the web as distribution channel you may want to look into the following articles: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"How-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-SEO.html\">How to drive traffic to your website - SEO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"How-to-write-article-for-the-web.html\">How to write an article for the web</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"entry-barriers-online-startup.html\">Entry barriers for an online startup</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

Is this true or just another myth?</p>\n<h2>The right question</h2>\n<p>The right question isn't if it is easy to start a business on the web.&nbsp;But rather if it is easy to be successful drawing traffic to your website.&nbsp;For the first question: yes. For the second question: no, it isn't.&nbsp;An online startup can only be considered as such if anyone can reach its website, otherwise it's just a hobby.</p>\n<h2>Getting to a good place</h2>\n<p>If you were to start a retail venture, you know its all about location, location, location.&nbsp;When you are talking about the web, what it really matters is to get a good rank on Google, on Bing, on Facebook, just to name a few.&nbsp;To be able to get that, your online startup needs to perform a ton of very important tasks, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>value creation,</li>\n<li>social Marketing,</li>\n<li>having a responsive website that is compliant with the SEO's best practices,</li>\n<li>you need to produce content,</li>\n<li>you need to get backlinks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The process of acquiring location</h2>\n<p>In our opinion, there are a lot of tasks that your startup needs to perform before investing in adwords or promoting your Facebook post.&nbsp;Applying best practices will make your marketing efforts have a more durable results.&nbsp;So, producing the right content, improving your content strategy, improving usability, improving website performance are goals that take time.&nbsp;From simple mistakes as including the wrong anchor texts (like click here), to having spelling mistakes on your website, using the wrong keywords on your content,&nbsp;the natural evolution of content/product offering resulting in a need of a different site structure.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/entry-barriers/barriers.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"entry barriers online startup\">\n<h2>How long is long enough</h2>\n<p>When should you start investing in SEM? There is no definitive answer. You should not see it on a time basis, but rather on stages.&nbsp;So you should go as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website live,</li>\n<li>Social networks on,</li>\n<li>Content improvement, </li>\n<li>Website's usability improvements (development),</li>\n<li>Website's SEO improvements (development),</li>\n<li>Build backlinks (SEO),</li>\n<li>Content improvement,</li>\n<li>Website restructure (development),</li>\n<li>Advertisement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;This process is iterative, so you need to take in account a long list of skills, if you don't want to drop serious money to get to a better location.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/entry-barriers/goodlocation.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"location google search\">\n<h2>Do I have the skills to do it?</h2>\n<p>Your startup will be constantly improving in many different aspects, like for example, your website, your SEO, and even your content.&nbsp;As so, you need a developer, a SEO guy and a content producer.&nbsp;The first option, and the best one, is for you to gain those skills and do it yourself.&nbsp;Another, is to include in your startup these elements either by giving up equity or by hiring them.&nbsp;Costs time, costs money, so it is definitely an entry barrier.</p>\n<h2>How relevant are the entry barriers for your startup</h2>\n<p>Not even looking into your startup's service or product, we already identified quite a number of tasks you need to do on an ongoing basis in order to be successful.&nbsp;We would say that they are probably high, not extremely high, but seriously relevant.&nbsp;It may be the case that you are amazing doing all of those tasks, but you will still take a long time doing them.&nbsp;The cost, either in money or in time of getting your startup's website into a good location is very relevant.</p>\n<h2>Final remarks</h2>\n<p>Although there are significant entry barriers, here at IdeaNinja we work to make it easier for your startup.&nbsp;We made several resources, opinions and tools available for your disposal.&nbsp;You can probably benefit from our series about article writing, to improve your content, and SEO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"How-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-SEO.html\">How to drive traffic to your website - SEO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"How-to-write-article-for-the-web.html\">How to write an article for the web</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"article-writing-tool.html\">Article Writer Tool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"Improve-your-website-design-free-photos.html\">Improve your website design with free photos</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

    "html": "\n<h2>What is CDN?</h2>\n<p>CDN stands for content delivery network and represents several proxy servers usually deployed all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The amount of time that goes from the moment your browser makes a request and the moment it receives its first response it’s called latency. Latency occurs due to the distance between your server and your clients.</p>\n<p>You can test it by doing a little exercise in your computer: open your command prompt by tipping cmd on windows or terminal if you’re on mac.</p>\n<p>Once you opened the terminal console, write “tracert”, if you’re on windows, or “tracerout”, if you have a mac, followed by your website (i.e. www.ideaninja.io). Click enter and you will see how many steps are between your server and your browser (you should see something similar to the picture).</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/CDN-performance/latency.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Trace route latency website\">\n<p>After that, compare to other websites by doing the same thing. The CDN will shorten the distance between the browser and your server and thus reducing latency.</p>\n<p>As you will see, your request goes through many IP’s before it can even reach the server where the site is hosted. So, the latency and speed of a website depends on how many steps are between the browser (i.e. chrome) and server (i.e. IdeaNinja).</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/CDN-performance/how_cdn_works.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"How CDN works\">\n<p>Think of CDN as a mirror for your server: it mimics your server across the world so that, when a request is made, it will answer with the closest server. This avoids a situation where your request has to go through several jumps across the world to reach its destination. Every time you change something in your server, the CDN will update.</p>\n<p>Basically, it will read your web site and cache its static content so it can present it while bypassing your server.&nbsp;When your website is accessed it will deliver the content without the request reaching your server thus reducing the amount of requests your servers needs to handle.&nbsp;This way, a CDN will help you having high availability and higher performance.&nbsp;Moreover, from our experience, it will reduce stress over your server making for saving for about 15% of your hosting needs.</p>\n<h2>In what conditions a CDN would be useful for my website?</h2>\n<p>If your site is having latency problems, low availability or if your startup is spending a lot of money on hosting then you should take a look into it.&nbsp;Several CDN's nowadays include in their services threat blocking services, which is always good.&nbsp;However, if your startup's website is fast and you have no latency problems, perhaps you would not benefit from a CDN.</p>\n<h2>Why does my website take so long to load?</h2>\n<p>Assuming that your code and the media presented is optimized, let's take a look into what happens when your website is accessed.&nbsp;So, the browser requests your page to be presented.&nbsp;That request hoops through routers, several pop connections and goes to your internet service provider and only then it finds your website's server address and routes the request to it.&nbsp;But it doesn't stop there. Then the request needs to reach your server. Let's say, for example, that your server is in UK and you are in the US: it needs to jump through several servers across countries to reach yours. And then your server answers when it has finished answering the several pending requests.&nbsp;The main idea is that the closer your server is to the request, the faster it will be, reducing its latency.</p>\n<h2>How can I test my website's speed?</h2>\n<p>We use this <a href=\"https://www.webpagetest.org/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">free service</a> and they don't ask for emails, or payment.&nbsp;It retrieves a nice report so that you can better understand why your website is slow.</p>\n<h2>How much will a CDN cost me?</h2>\n<p>There are several CDNs that are free like (freemium model):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BootstrapCDN</li>\n<li>CloudFlare</li>\n<li>Coral Content Distribution Network</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most popular nowadays is probably Cloudflare.&nbsp;Other CDN providers, like telcos, charge a fee for this service.</p>\n<h2>How to setup a Cloudflare for my website?</h2>\n<p>Since Cloudflare is the most popular one let's explain how to set it up:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, you need to create a CloudFlare account and add a website,</li>\n<li>Secondly, you are going to change your domain name servers to CloudFlare</li>\n<li>At last, you can choose your setting on the caching feature, or setup redirects or security settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n<p>Hopefully this article has helped you improve your knowledge and placed you on the right track to improve your site's performance or saving some money.&nbsp;IdeaNinja is always trying to help you.&nbsp;If you liked this article you should read some of our latest articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ideaninja.io/entry-barriers-online-startup.html\" target=\"blank\">Entry barriers for online startup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ideaninja.io/free-hosting-find-out-how.html\" target=\"blank\">Free Hosting!

    "html":"\n<h2>What we mean by free</h2>\n<p>Are you looking for free photos to use for a design and do you want to keep, yourself and your startup, out of copyright trouble? If so, you should to know this, there are the following types of free:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Creative Commons zero - </b> you can use the photos in any way you'd like without asking permission.</li>\n<li><b>Creative Commons with attribution - </b>you can use the photo in any way you want but you need to attribute credits to the creator of the photo. Attribution is simple: when you include a photo in the web page, you need to identify the photographer (\"Photo by John Doe\") and include a link to the website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>All the websites presented are free of charge and the use of their pictures is attribution free (creative commons zero).</b></p>\n<h2>Is it worth the risk?</h2>\n<p>If someone finds their content on your website, they can ask to take down your site. It works as a preventive measure to make sure you remove other people’s content for good. So if you think you can get away with using other people’s images for free, think twice. Your website can go through a DMCA takedown if you’re not careful. A DMCA takedown happens when content is removed from your website at the request of the owner of that content or its rights. DMCA is basically a copyright law. It protects those who believe their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed, due to unauthorized use of their materials on the Internet. Although the law is from USA, it can be applied anywhere in the world. Once it happens to you, you can say goodbye to all your SEO efforts. Is it really worth it for a photo?</p>\n<h2>IdeaNinja's totally free photo websites TOP</h2>\n<p>These are our favorite websites for free photos.

    "html":"\n<p>So you created a website. Now it's time to roll it out. This is what you need to do before following these instructions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a domain,</li>\n<li>Have a website built,</li>\n<li>Register on Github.com,</li>\n<li>Install Git.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Github</h2>\n<p>Github is an online service that enables developers to share and develop software.&nbsp;Github is based on Git, a widely used source code management system for software development.&nbsp;So it is critical that you understand some very basic Git scripts.&nbsp;In the course of this article we will teach you how to use Git and Github to get your website published and updated.</p>\n<h2>Git and Github</h2>\n<p>In Git and on Github there are a few concepts you need to understand to get your free hosting.&nbsp;First and most importantly, there are repositories which are pretty much projects.&nbsp;Then there are branches. Branches are like different versions or tastes of that project. So your project can branch off into different branches.</p>\n<h2>DOM files</h2>\n<p>The DOM files are the files that the browser retrieves from the server where your site is hosted, in order to present a website.&nbsp;They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>html pages,</li>\n<li>CSS files,</li>\n<li>JS Files,</li>\n<li>images,</li>\n<li>icons,</li>\n<li>videos,</li>\n<li>all other elements present in your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is a Domain</h2>\n<p>A domain is basically the name of your website, like ideaninja.io or google.com. This name needs to be purchased and you need to hold the credentials to manage this domain, if you want to have a custom domain, instead of using the one that github will give you.</p>\n<h2>Step 1 – Create Github repository</h2>\n<p>Go to Github and create a repository on Github for your website. Note that your branch now is called Master.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/free-hosting/newrepo.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"New repository on Github\">\n<h2>Step 2 – Create gh-pages branch</h2>\n<p>Create a new branched named gh-pages.</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/free-hosting/newbranch.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"New branch on Github\">\n<h2>Step 3 – Clone the repository</h2>\n<p>To clone the Github repository you have just created to your PC, create a new folder named Github and from there open a console by typing cmd, on windows, or terminal, if you are on mac. Then go to the folder you have just created and write the following command:</p>\n<p style=\"margins: 20px\">Git clone [repo url] --branch gh.pages .</p>\n<p>Note: The repo url you can find on your repository page on Github where it says https. Copy it to the command and run it.</p>\n<p>You will notice that some files have been downloaded.</p>\n<h2>Step 4 – Adding the DOM files to your repository</h2>\n<p>Now copy the DOM files to the local repository you have just created. And in the command line write:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>git add . - please notice the dot</li>\n<li>git commit -m “[write the description of this first submission]”</li>\n<li>Git push</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The terminal should ask you for your username and password from Github.</p><p>\n</p><p>After that, if you go to your gh-pages branch in your Github repository you should see the files you have just pushed.</p>\n<h2>Step 5 – Test your new free hosting</h2>\n<p>Test your website, through the following URL [username].github.io/[repository name]</p>\n<h2>Step 6 – Customizing the domain</h2>\n<p>Now, to get your site to respond in your custom domain, that you have purchased, add a File named CNAME (all Caps and no extension) and in that file write down your domain to your local repository. Repeat the same steps you did in step 4 (add, commit, push).</p>\n<div>\n<p>Now, go to your domain manager (website where you purchased the domain) and edit the Zone file or change it to this:</p>\n<img src=\"images/articles/free-hosting/zonefile.jpg\" id=\"articleimg\" alt=\"Domain zonefile website\">\n<p>or this: <br>\n@ 10800 IN A 192.30.252.153<br>\n@ 10800 IN A 192.30.252.154<br>\nwww 10800 IN CNAME @<br></p>\n</div>\n<p>Usually you can do this in DNS management, but it might be located in a different place, depending on the provider you have used.</p>\n<p>Make sure that your domain is using the zone file you edited/created.</p>\n<p>Note: it may take a few hours before the website is available. These new settings need to be propagated through the ISP, so don't worry if you cannot see your site right after you completed these 6 steps.</p>\n"

Tackling a new area of knowledge is filled with hurdles and you may need guidance, and thus finding an expert that will serve as a mentor is gold. However, as always, there are a ton of resources online that will explain you how to do it.</p>\n<h2>Finding your mentors</h2>\n<p>First, navigating through a new skill is a hustle. And getting that first step right is so critical. Mentors can have a huge influence pointing you into the right direction. In other words, you need help finding good content and avoiding all of the bad advices and clutter that you can find on the web. In such moments, it is crucial to find a mentor. A mentor can be someone you know or anyone who has the knowledge you need and you can ask for directions. If it is someone you don't know, you can look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bloggers who are experts in the subject you are looking for,</li>\n<li>Top forums contributors - search for users with a lot of points or answers and try to get in contact with them,</li>\n<li>Authors of technical books and look for seminars that have been posted on YouTube.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it is someone you know, it can be a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Friend,</li>\n<li>Former co-worker,</li>\n<li>Teacher from college.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, an expert that will lead you into the right track. You may not have the luck of having someone that you can contact to give the guidance you need. In that case, you should consider getting online training.

Contact your mentors as soon as possible to clarify doubts and, most importantly, give you a framework you can work with.</p>\n<h2>Last piece of advice</h2>\n<p>Summing up, while creating a startup, you will find many new challenges. Several of those challenges will be new areas of knowledge. To steepen the learning curve, get a mentor. Try to come up with questions and themes as early as you can and pick the adult's brain as best as you can. Most importantly, get in the right path. It will save you a ton of pain.</p>\n"
