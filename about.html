If that wasn't enough, research has shown that even-though information is more readily available than ever, the success rate hasn't changed significantly. As shown in the article reasons why startups fail, product - market fit, human resources, and marketing are still the main reasons startups fail. However the hype about entrepreneurship is heavily focused on other issues, like financing, partnerships and major innovation. The basics, like building a team for the job, creating a good product for the market and getting through to the client, continues to be less spoken of.</p><h2>The myth</h2><p>In the world of info-entertainment, entrepreneurship is described very poorly. Many shows give the impression that entrepreneurship is all about raising money, having loads of success and becoming a millionaire. However as previously discussed, the numbers show a very different reality. Entrepreneurship is more about, simplicity, testing assumptions, mitigating risk, and dealing with people. Getting the basics right, will go a long way.</p><h2>The equity hype</h2><p>I could never understand why some entrepreneurs are more eager to sell equity than their own product. It always seemed that, if you really believe in your business, you should keep as much of it as possible and finance its operations through sales. But the first question many entrepreneurs ask themselves is: how do we get funding ? The best source of financing is through sales. So it should really be: how can i sell more? Can you do it ?</p><h2>Ideaninja</h2><p>Ideaninja was founded to help the entrepreneur become successful. We write regularly on the blog, from time to time we build small tools to help you with the job, build training sessions and have services tailored to complement your company skills and help you grow.
