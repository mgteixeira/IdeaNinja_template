Go to our tool <a target=blank href=/automatic_pitch_machine.html>Automatic Pitch Machine</a></p><h2>When to apply a pitch</h2><p>Every day in many circumstances we pitch. to break it down you have:<ul><li>Email (the subject line is a pitch and the body is another pitch)</li><li>Talk (telephone or personal)</li><li>Meetings</li><li>Presentations</li></ul></p><h2>Desired results</h2><p>The goal of a pitch is to generate engagement and generate buzz through word of mouth. To generate engagement you need show relevance and utility. To generate buzz you need it to be memorable and valuable. The value of a pitch relates to the scarcity and urgency of what you are trying to sell.</p><img src=images/articles/perfect_pitch/perfect_pitch.jpg id=articleimg alt="success pitch"><h2>Time constraints</h2><p>Ideally you would have all the time you need to pitch. But you don't. So lets introduce the time constraints into the pitch:</p><ul><li>Subject line or Headline: 8 words</li><li>Web or email: 1 paragraph or 60 to 100 words</li><li>Elevator pitch: 30 second or 60 words</li><li>Telephone pitch: 5 minutes or 600 words</li><li>Meeting or presentation: 15 min or 1800 words</li></ul><h2>30 seconds Pitch examples</h2><p>We looked into some of the best pitches and broke it down for you. These are some of the structures that you can use:</p><ul><li>The pixar pitch</li><ul><li>The structure:</li><p>Once upon a time [set the scenario and introduces characters]. Everyday, [somethings happens that translates the status quo]. One day [something changed, introduced the solution] and because of that, [benefits] until finally [experience].</p><li>Example:</li><p>Once upon a time there was an entrepreneur with a bad pitch. Every day he tried to make a sale, convince people to cooperate in his quest but without any success. One day he decided do build his pitch based on this article and because of that, he worked on his pitch until finally sales started coming, buzz happened and he became very successful.</p></ul><li>Shark tank's Beatbox beverages pitch</li><ul><li>The structure:</li><p>[status quo]... boring!<br>We are not booring, we have [product 1, product 2, product 3]. It's not just [product type]. It's an experience!<br>You [do this] and [this happens]. [Features a juxtaposition with status quo]. Product is [tagline]</p><li>Example:</li><div class=out_vid><div class=art_vid><iframe class=vid height=auto width=100% src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbNaTNX-1DU frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></ul><li>Shark Tank's Breathometer pitch</li><ul><li>The structure:</li><p>Just imagine [situation], before you know it [this happens], and the most important question is [question] and who wants [status quo]. Introducing [product and features].</p><li>Example:</li><div class=out_vid><div class=art_vid><iframe class=vid src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqtM9brwBDg frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></ul><li>2010's Award Winning at MIT's Global startup workshop</li><ul><li>The structure:</li><p>[fact][question showing relevancy].[question about status quo that makes the pain point evident]. [answer].[present the product, benefits and features]. [explain why it is better than alternatives].</p><li>Example:</li><div class=out_vid><div class=art_vid><iframe class=vid src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBNJh2rOOlI frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></ul></ul><h2>Selling identity or a product/service ?</h2><p>When people buy a product or service they are actually buying access or confirmation of to an identity. It is all about perception. Clients perceive to be someone thus needing a service or product or they want to achieve a new status and thus they need to be buy something to get there.</p><h2>Engagement = relevance * utility</h2><p>What you are trying to pitch needs to be relevant to your listener, if you are to have his attention. start the description on the customer's current status and go back and forward between their pain points and consequences of continuing without solving their problem. Now enter the Utility. Juxtapose the consequences to the experiences of your service or product.Explain the benefits and the features, but focus on experiences.</p><h2>Delivery? What tone?</h2><p>Tone is something you want to work on. What is the best tone to communicate with your clients? That will depend on the language and tone used by your customers. You want to use an appropriate tone considering your customers and what they want to achieve. The amount of energy, it all depends on what you are selling and who are your customers.</p><h2>What you should include</h2><p>Novelty - Make sure what you are pitching is something new. It might be your angle or your approach. Certainty - show facts, research, numbers to support your claims. This gives credibility to your pitch. Questions induce feelings. Make them feel the pain points and the relief it would be to surpass them and what new experiences they can achieve if those hurdles are surpassed.</p></div></article><article id=contactus><h1>Contact Us</h1><p>Please feel free to participate.
