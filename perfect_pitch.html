A perfect pitch is the ultimate selling weapon. By email, in the elevator, on a telephone, on a presentation, on a meeting or in a social interaction. Turn your efforts into success stories by improving your pitch. In this article we will take a look into successful product pitch examples.</p><h2>Tools</h2><p>We have prepared a tool for you to get your pitch done with minimal fuss. Go to our tool <a target=blank href=/automatic_pitch_machine.html>Automatic Pitch Machine,</a> and find some product pitch examples and make your own pitch.</p><h2>When to apply a pitch</h2><p>Every day in many circumstances we pitch. To break it down you have:<ul><li>Email (the subject line is a pitch and the body is another pitch),</li><li>Talk (telephone or personal),</li><li>Meetings,</li><li>Presentations.</li></ul></p><h2>Desired results</h2><p>The goal of a pitch is to generate engagement and generate buzz through word of mouth. To generate engagement you need to show relevance and utility. To generate buzz you need it to be memorable and valuable. The value of a pitch relates to the scarcity and urgency of what you are trying to sell.</p><img src=images/articles/perfect_pitch/perfect_pitch.jpg id=articleimg alt="success pitch"><h2>Time constraints</h2><p>Ideally you would have all the time you need to pitch. But you don't. So let's introduce the time constraints into the pitch:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Subject line or Headline: 8 words</li><li>Web or email: 1 paragraph or 60 to 100 words</li><li>Elevator pitch: 30 second or 60 words</li><li>Telephone pitch: 5 minutes or 600 words</li><li>Meeting or presentation: 15 min or 1800 words</li></ul></blockquote><h2>30 seconds Pitch examples</h2><p>We looked into some of the best product pitch examples and broke it down for you. These are some of the structures that you can use:</p><h3>The pixar pitch</h3><ul><li>The structure:</li><blockquote><p>Once upon a time [set the scenario and introduces characters]. Everyday, [somethings happens that translates the status quo]. One day [something changed, introduced the solution] and because of that, [benefits] until finally [experience].</p></blockquote><li>Example:</li><blockquote><p>Once upon a time there was an entrepreneur with a bad pitch. Every day he tried to make a sale, convince people to cooperate in his quest but without any success. One day, he decided to build his pitch based on this article and because of that, he worked on his pitch until finally sales started coming, buzz happened and he became very successful.</p></blockquote></ul><h3>Shark Tank's Beatbox beverages pitch</h3><ul><li>The structure:</li><blockquote><p>[status quo]... boring!<br>We are not boring, we have [product 1, product 2, product 3]. It's not just [product type]. It's an experience!<br>You [do this] and [this happens]. [Features a juxtaposition with status quo]. Product is [tagline]</p></blockquote><li>Example:</li><blockquote><p>A delightful cabernet in France, it's perfect. There is just one problem... It's boring!<br>We are Beatbox beverages and we are not boring, we are changing box wine forever with flavors like cranberry lemonade and blue raspberry. It's not just a box. It's an experience!<br>Take your beatbox to the next party and you're instantly a legend. We are using an unique orange wine that drinks more like a spirit then a wine, and allow us to create mixed drinks that our customers ultimately love. Beatbox is a party in a box.</p></blockquote><iframe width=100% height=100% src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSharkTank%2Fvideos%2F870891856255287%2F&width=500&show_text=false&appId=1575052359489385" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></ul></div><h3>Shark Tank's Breathometer pitch</h3><ul><li>The structure:</li><blockquote><p>Just imagine [situation], before you know it [this happens], and the most important question is [question] and who wants [status quo]. Introducing [product and features].</p></blockquote><li>Example:</li><blockquote><p>Just imagine you are in a bar with some friends having some drinks, before you know it, it's time to go home, and the most important question is: are you safe to drive? And who wants to carry one big old breathalyser around. That is why we created the first smartphone breathalyzer.</p></blockquote></ul><div class=video-container><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rx8I703K2RI frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><li>2010's Award Winning at MIT's Global startup workshop</li><ul><li>The structure:</li><blockquote><p>[fact][question showing relevancy].[question about status quo that makes the pain point evident]. [answer].[present the product, benefits and features]. [explain why it is better than alternatives].</p></blockquote><li>Example:</li></ul><div class=video-container><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBNJh2rOOlI frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2>Selling identity or a product/service?</h2><p>When people buy a product or service, they are actually buying access or confirmation of to an identity. It is all about perception. Clients perceive to be someone thus needing a service or product, or they want to achieve a new status and thus they need to buy something to get there.</p><h2>Engagement = relevance * utility</h2><p>What you are trying to pitch, needs to be relevant to your listener, if you whant to have his attention. Start the description on the customer's current status and go back and forward between their pain points and consequences of continuing without solving their problem. Now enter the Utility. Juxtapose the consequences to the experiences of your service or product. Explain the benefits and the features, but focus on experiences.</p><h2>Delivery? What tone?</h2><p>Tone is something you want to work on. What is the best tone to communicate with your clients? That will depend on the language and tone used by your customers. You want to use an appropriate tone considering your customers and what they want to achieve. The amount of energy, it all depends on what you are selling and who are your customers.</p><h2>What you should include</h2><p><strong>Novelty</strong> - make sure that what you are pitching is something new. It might be your angle or your approach. Certainty - show facts, research, numbers to support your claims. This gives credibility to your pitch. Questions induce feelings. Make them feel the pain points and the relief it would be to surpass them and what new experiences they can achieve if those hurdles are surpassed.</p></div></div><div id=searchheader></div><div id=cardsrow><div id=endofcards></div></div></div><footer class=page-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col l6 s12"><h5 class=white-text>Connect with the Dojo</h5><a href=https://www.facebook.com/IdeaNinja.io rel=nofollow target=blank><img class=socialfooter src=images\socialmedia\facebook.png alt="facebook social"></a> <a href=https://twitter.com/idea_ninja rel=nofollow target=blank><img class=socialfooter src=images\socialmedia\twitter.png alt="twitter social"></a> <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCPC0CjOZy4CRuNMvQp-kQ rel=nofollow target=blank><img src=images\socialmedia\youtube.png alt="youtube social" class=socialfooter></a> <a href=https://linkedin.com/company/idea-ninja rel=nofollow target=blank><img src=images\socialmedia\linkedin.png alt="linkedin social" class=socialfooter></a></div><div class="col l3 s6"><h5 class=white-text>Legal Stuff</h5><ul><li><a class="grey-text text-lighten-3" href=terms_of_service.html>Terms of Service</a></li><li><a class="grey-text text-lighten-3" href=privacy_policy.html>Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></div><div class="col l3 s6"><h5 class=white-text>Other Stuff</h5><ul><li><a class="grey-text text-lighten-3" href=about.html>About Us</a></li><li><a class="grey-text text-lighten-3" href=services.html>Services</a></li><li><a class="grey-text text-lighten-3" href=publishing_guidelines.html>Join the Ninjas</a></li><li><a class="grey-text text-lighten-3" href=contactus.html>Contact Us</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=footer-copyright><div class=container>© 2015 - Idea Ninja, Unipessoal, Lda</div></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js></script><script src=https://unpkg.com/lunr/lunr.js></script><script src=/js/materialize.js></script><script src=/js/init.js></script><script src=/js/jquery.timeago.min.js></script><script src=/js/cardDisplay.js></script></body></html>
